The composition of each diet was 55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15% protein. All participants in two groups were given a diet of 500-kcal less than their caloric needs in the intervention period. Participants were being visited every week; each session for each participant lasted 20-30 min. Behavioral counseling was instigated for all participants. The nutritionist described the advantages of diets for the participants, explaining that the central obesity could be controlled by continuing the diets. Diets were prescribed individually using a calorie count system. An “exchange list” was also given to each participant for calorie counting and exchanging food items. A nutritionist taught participants how to write “food diaries”. Each participant had to write her 3 days diet and physical-activity records before the run-in period as well as before, in the middle, and at the end of the intervention. The diaries were evaluated by the investigators. A validated menu of 7 days with 42 meals and snacks at 17 calorie levels (1,200-2800) was developed for each diet. Participant compliance was evaluated by reviewing the 3 days food records and weekly visits. Each week, the number of reported food-group exchanges from 3 days food records was compared with prescribed exchanges. Participants who completed ≥ 80% of the planned diets were encouraged to follow it diligently for the subsequent weeks.

The true isocaloric needs of some of the subjects were different from the amount determined in the equation from the Food and Nutrition Board at the Institute of Medicine. In such cases, an isocaloric diet would cause the reduction or gain of weight rather than weight maintenance. Such individuals could cause biases in the study. Hence, among individuals eligible to enter the study, only those who maintained their weight at the end of the run-in period using an isocaloric diet calculated according to the equation were selected (n = 42). Moreover, the dietary pattern of each participant was different and could affect the results of interventions. Therefore, a run-in period was planned to standardize macronutrient consumption and to get detailed information about the study population. After 2 weeks of the run-in period on an isocaloric diet, subjects were randomly assigned into two groups: (1) HDEL and (2) HDWL for 6 weeks. To get randomized and matched groups, all participants were divided into four groups using factor analysis method. Participants in each group were similar in general characteristics and CVD risk factors. Participants in each group were then randomly allocated to two study groups.
