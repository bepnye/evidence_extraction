Based on patients’ assessment responses, a tailored report was generated and distributed to physicians and their patients who smoke. The current intervention was innovative in several ways. Unlike previous computer-tailored interventions that were directed toward patients only, the current intervention targeted both patients and physicians in “real time” during the medical visit. Also, to maximize its use in the time-strapped primary care environment, the tailored report was considerably shorter than the previously tested versions. The intervention had two objectives: (1) to bolster the rate at which physicians delivered smoking cessation services and (2) to increase patients’ quit rates. Providing both the smoker and his/her physician with a report at the time of the health care visit was expected to cue physicians to deliver smoking cessation counseling as well as activate patients to elicit such counseling. In addition to its cuing function, the report was intended to compensate for limitations in physician time and knowledge of counseling techniques, thus bolstering treatment capacity. We hypothesized that the intervention would surpass usual care on physician implementation of the 5As, quit rate, length of quit attempts, number of quit attempts, and stage-of-change progression.</offsets></p><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="10402" xml_f="10409" txt_i="5914" txt_f="5921">METHODS</offsets></title><sec id="Sec2"><title><offsets xml_i="10439" xml_f="10467" txt_i="5922" txt_f="5950">Study Design and Recruitment</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10478" xml_f="11011" txt_i="5951" txt_f="6484">A randomized controlled trial was conducted to examine the effectiveness of a tailored smoking cessation intervention directed toward physicians and patients during a routine office visit.
