It is required to identify subtypes of ARDS to guideline clinical treatment and trial design. The study aimed to identify subtypes of ARDS using latent class analysis (LCA). The study was a secondary analysis of the EDEN study, which was a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial conducted from January 2, 2008 to April 12, 2011. The primary study endpoint was death through 90-day follow up. LCA was performed incorporating variables on day 0 before randomization. The number of classes was chosen by a bootstrapped likelihood ratio test, Bayesian information criterion and the number of patients in each class. A total of 943 patients were enrolled in the study, including 219 (23.2%) non-survivors and 724 (76.8%) survivors. The LCA identified three classes of ARDS.

While more fluid balance was beneficial for class 1, it was harmful for class 2 and 3. In conclusion, the study identified three classes of ARDS, which showed different clinical presentations, responses to fluid therapy and prognosis.

mortality risk (e.g., class 1 had significantly higher mortality rate than class 2 and 3). Class 1 was a hemodynamically unstable type characterized by lower mean blood pressure and higher heart rate. Class 2 was an intermediate type that the SIRS response appears less severe than class 1. Class 3 was a group with stable vital signs. Multivariable regression model showed that while more fluid balance is potentially beneficial for class 1, more fluid balance was associated with increased risk of death for classes 2 and 3. The identification of these subtypes of ARDS may help to triage ARDS patients that respond differently to fluid therapy, and to design future clinical trials by using simple clinical variables.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32210" xml_f="32274" txt_i="15986" txt_f="16050">It has long been noticed that ARDS is not a homogenous disease (</offsets><xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="32309" xml_f="32348" txt_i="16050" txt_f="16085">Rezoagli, Fumagalli &amp; Bellani, 2017</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32355" xml_f="32544" txt_i="16085" txt_f="16274">), but it encompasses a highly heterogeneous patient population who have remarkable differences in genetic background, clinical characteristics, treatment responses and mortality outcomes (</offsets><xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="32579" xml_f="32605" txt_i="16274" txt_f="16296">Meyer &amp; Christie, 2013</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32612" xml_f="32614" txt_i="16296" txt_f="16298">; </offsets><xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="32649" xml_f="32678" txt_i="16298" txt_f="16323">Shaver &amp; Bastarache, 2014</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32685" xml_f="32687" txt_i="16323" txt_f="16325">; </offsets><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr"></xref><offsets xml_i="32729" xml_f="33229" txt_i="16325" txt_f="16825">). ARDS is clinically classified as a syndrome simply because it describes a collection of commonly encountered symptoms in critically ill patients, which typically involves acute onset, bilateral lung infiltrates, low oxygenation and requirement of respiratory support. Since ARDS is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome, many efforts have been made to categorize it into subtypes or classes. Brown and colleagues classified ARDS patients into four subtypes according to their six-month health status (</offsets><xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="33263" xml_f="33281" txt_i="16825" txt_f="16843">Brown et al., 2017</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33288" xml_f="33877" txt_i="16843" txt_f="17432">). However, this classification system required data over a six-month period and cannot be used at the beginning of disease onset. The strength of the present study was that clinical variables collected at the early stage of ARDS onset were employed, which can help clinicians to identify subtypes of ARDS that have different clinical outcomes and treatment responses. In another study, the authors employed inflammatory biomarkers to classify ARDS into two subphenotypes and the results showed that these subphenotypes had differences in clinical outcomes and responses to PEEP strategy (</offsets><xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="33911" xml_f="33930" txt_i="17432" txt_f="17451">Calfee et al., 2014</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33937" xml_f="34311" txt_i="17451" txt_f="17825">). Type 2 was characterized by hyperinflammatory responses, corresponding to the class 1 in our study. They further investigated the difference in the effect of liberal versus conservative fluid treatment strategy on clinical outcomes between the two subphenotypes. Fluid management strategy had significantly different effects on 90-day mortality in the two subphenotypes (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="34319" xml_f="34320" txt_i="17825" txt_f="17826">p</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="34329" xml_f="35768" txt_i="17826" txt_f="19265"> = 0.0039 for interaction). While conservative strategy resulted in higher mortality than liberal strategy in subphenotype 1 (26% vs. 18%), mortality in subphenotype 2 was lower with fluid-conservative strategy than the liberal strategy (40% vs. 50%). In this study, more positive fluid balance appeared to be associated with reduced risk of death in class 1, while the effect was opposite in class 2 and 3. The adverse effect of positive fluid balance was prominent in class 3 (corresponding to the hypo-inflammatory subphenotype). It is reasonable that ARDS patients without shock can benefit from conservative fluid strategy to reduce pulmonary edema. On the contrary, for patients with unstable hemodynamics, maintaining tissue perfusion by liberal fluid strategy is the priority. However, the biomarkers in Calfee’s study are not available in routine clinical practice, inhibiting its widespread use. In contrast, the present study employed simple variables that were readily available in all clinical institutions, making external validation of the classification system feasible. Famous and colleagues further showed that a parsimonious model involving only three variables interleukin-8, bicarbonate and tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 could accurately identify the two-class model. However, these biomarkers except for bicarbonate are still not routinely tested in real clinical practice, especially in some low-income countries.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35775" xml_f="36910" txt_i="19266" txt_f="20401">Several limitations need to be acknowledged in the study. The study was a secondary analysis of a clinical trial, which was subject to inherent limitations of the post hoc analysis. Sample size and statistical power were not designed for the LCA statistical model. Fluid strategy was not randomized in the original study, raising the problem of selection bias, e.g., more fluid was given to class 1 patients. In this case, class membership is a confounder for the relationship between fluid balance and mortality outcome. In the present study, any such confounding effect was adjusted for by the use of multivariable regression model. Another limitation of the study is that LCA results are not readily transferable to a score or some other algorithm to help triage ARDS patients. The next step may be to build a multinomial logistic regression model by regressing latent class on candidate predictors to obtain the weight (regression coefficient) for each of the predictors. In this way, a mathematical equation or nomogram can be built to predict the probability of belonging to a subclass for a given patient with known predictors (</offsets><xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36945" xml_f="36969" txt_i="20401" txt_f="20421">Zhang &amp; Kattan, 2017</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36976" xml_f="36978" txt_i="20421" txt_f="20423">).</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="37023" xml_f="37033" txt_i="20425" txt_f="20435">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37044" xml_f="37295" txt_i="20436" txt_f="20687">In conclusion, this study identified three classes of ARDS, which showed different clinical outcomes and treatment responses to fluid therapy.
