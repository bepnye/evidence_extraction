The LHRHa group acted as a benchmark in view of the uncertainty about the underlying cardiovascular risk in the cohort. The 2:1 randomisation ratio was designed to maximise experience with oestrogen patches. After regimen two was introduced in the oestrogen-patch group, the required sample size was increased to 250 patients overall (133 to regimen two). If strong evidence of a 15% or higher cardiovascular-event rate in the oestrogen-patch arm was seen (based on the lower limit of a 95% CI), an early review by the independent data monitoring committee would be triggered and trial closure could be considered. The numbers of events required to trigger a review were ten or more in the first 33 patients assigned oestrogen patches, 17 in 67 patients, 23 in 100 patients, and 29 in 133 patients.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21467" xml_f="23577" txt_i="13423" txt_f="15533">The primary cardiovascular analysis was based on modified intention-to-treat principles: patients were assessed in the oestrogen-patch group if they had been treated with patches at any point, and assessed in the LHRHa group if they had received LHRHa but not patches at any point; patients who received no treatment at all were excluded. This approach was expected to be conservative because it maximised the number of events attributed to oestrogen patches. The proportion of patients who experienced an event is reported with exact binomial 95% CIs. As crossover was allowed in the case of disease progression, we did a planned sensitivity analysis in which we included numbers of events according to treatment being taken at the time of (or within 30 days before) the events. Analysis of the primary outcome was planned for 3 months after the last randomisation to enable a prompt decision regarding continuation of the study, whereas assessment of the secondary outcomes were done 15 months after the last randomisation to enable assessment of changes over time. Secondary outcomes were assessed in men who were still receiving their assigned study treatment with no additional prostate-cancer therapy at the time of interest. Men with oestradiol concentrations of 250 pmol/L or lower, or who were reported to have stopped using patches (where oestradiol data were not available) were not assessed. Castration rates (proportion of men with testosterone concentrations of 1·7 nmol/L or lower) at 3 months and 6 months are reported. Post-hoc analyses included the proportions of patients who achieved lower testosterone thresholds (1·1 mmol/L and 0·7 nmol/L) and differences between LHRHas. Cardiovascular risk factors are reported as mean (95% CI) at 6 and 12 months, as well as mean (%) changes from baseline. Treatment effects were investigated with ANCOVA models adjusted for baseline values. Checks of model assumptions and fit included assessment of residual plots and tests. We did no formal treatment comparisons of toxic effects. All analyses were done with Stata statistical software (version 12).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23584" xml_f="23986" txt_i="15534" txt_f="15936">In this study, we report data from the preplanned analysis of cardiovascular outcomes in the first 254 patients.

Notable effects in the oestrogen-patches group were gynaecomastia and minor skin disorders. Fewer episodes of hot flushes were reported than in the LHRHa group. In this population of elderly men, the effects of treatments can be difficult to distinguish from normal signs and symptoms associated with increasing age. Thus, effects on wider features, such as cognition and quality of life in particular, require more detailed investigation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41461" xml_f="42722" txt_i="31096" txt_f="32357">Oestrogen patches seem to be a potential alternative to LHRHa for men with prostate cancer. Patches offer a low-cost, single therapy that can be self-administered, and which might avoid some of the side-effects associated with LHRHa. Therefore, if shown to be effective in phase 3 trials, oestrogen patches might appeal to patients and clinicians. The observations that oestrogen did not increase either fasting glucose or cholesterol concentrations compared with LHRHa are important and strengthen the rationale for further assessment. For individual patients treatment decisions will need to be balanced and take into account antitumour effects, risks of cardiovascular events, effects on bone health, quality of life, including sexual dysfunction, and possible negative effects on cognition. These latter effects are commonly overlooked when physicians are deciding the best method of achieving androgen deprivation. A large phase 3 study will be required to assess all these features of treatment fully. Overall, though, the need to prioritise the assessment of a potential method of androgen deprivation that could avoid the toxic effects associated with standard therapy, and to avoid the addition of new and expensive agents to counteract them, is clear.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other"
