We conducted a prospective randomized trial and invited early breast cancer patients to continuously record their symptoms according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 via a novel electronic study device (mobile or Web app) and to also indicate their Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status. Information for supportive care was also displayed by the app depending on the severity of symptoms upon data entry. The cumulative recorded data were made available to the patient in chart form (similar to a stock chart) at any time during the study.

Patients could report daily functional activity or symptoms with indication of severity in the electronic app device similar to the paper questionnaire. The visual analog scale from the questionnaire was substituted with a horizontal slider. Similar to the questionnaire, the label of symptom severity and category according to CTCAE was displayed below the slider. During the visits, nurses reminded the participants according to their randomization to use the app, but no other reminders were issued. Patients could edit a quick list of their preselected symptoms or select any of the 48 symptoms made available from the CTCAE listing. Only for group C was the treating physician enabled access to review and discuss the electronically reported symptoms during scheduled visits.

Given this sample size, a power of 80%, and a mean frequency of 4.4 (SD 3.3) adverse events, we expected to detect a difference in mean frequency of 2.2 adverse events per group.

We demonstrate that a mobile app merits the potential to stabilize the daily functional activity of early breast cancer patients. Supervision and review of patient-reported symptoms in collaboration with their physician encouraged a timely and sincere discussion of symptoms reported in the app. Moreover, despite a rather short intervention period, supervised patients (group C) experienced a significant benefit with respect to daily functional activity in contrast to the unsupervised patients (group B and controls). These findings are in accordance with data gained from advanced cancer patients with longer follow-up managed by email prompts [</offsets><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="37844" xml_f="37845" txt_i="21408" txt_f="21409">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37852" xml_f="37854" txt_i="21409" txt_f="21411">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37861" xml_f="38495" txt_i="21412" txt_f="22046">Patient-physician collaboration might have influenced the patients in three ways. First, the stabilization of daily functional activity seemed partially linked to a change in behavior, reflected by a more precise recording of symptoms in supervised patients, whereas fewer data entries were recorded than in unsupervised patients. Potentially augmenting existing mechanisms for symptom management along with routine oncology care, supervised app users also seemed to attain the ability to better differentiate and communicate their treatment-related symptoms, which consequentially facilitates appropriate management by the physician.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38502" xml_f="39140" txt_i="22047" txt_f="22685">Furthermore, supervised patients were more likely than unsupervised patients and controls to communicate their dissatisfaction. It seems plausible that an increase in self-confidence may also positively affect daily functional activity. Strengthened self-confidence is likely reflected in decreasing incidence of concentration issues reported during the visits and an increasing use of the Internet to obtain further information about disease and related treatment in both groups using the mobile app. Previous studies also indicate that physicians, as well as the majority of patients, believe that mobile apps facilitate communication [</offsets><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="39174" xml_f="39176" txt_i="22685" txt_f="22687">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39183" xml_f="39227" txt_i="22687" txt_f="22731">] and increase the frequency of discussion [</offsets><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="39261" xml_f="39263" txt_i="22731" txt_f="22733">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39270" xml_f="39293" txt_i="22733" txt_f="22756">] during consultations.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39300" xml_f="39386" txt_i="22757" txt_f="22843">In addition, patients receiving chemotherapy frequently report cognitive impairments [</offsets><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="39419" xml_f="39420" txt_i="22843" txt_f="22844">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39427" xml_f="39933" txt_i="22844" txt_f="23350">]. In our study, both the supervised and unsupervised groups recorded improvements in worst daily functional activity in the app before the visit, although this became less evident from the questionnaires during the visit. The diary character of our mobile app is helpful for recalling disease-related information. This feature may have positive and negative consequences.

One patient had functional problems with the recording of symptoms in the app. Five patients withdrew their participation from the study to avoid the constant confrontation with their disease. Of note, these patients in group C had the worst reported daily functional activity between the first and second visit. In general, group C was more likely to communicate their dissatisfaction with quality of care than group B and the controls. Maybe also patients in group B would have withdrawn from the study if their communication skills had been comparably strengthened. Furthermore, the daily recording of symptoms plus the supervision of symptoms during the visit in group C might be an additional burden. For some patients, this continuous workup of their symptoms might be too intense.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="40826" xml_f="40837" txt_i="24217" txt_f="24228">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40848" xml_f="41363" txt_i="24229" txt_f="24744">There are several limitations of this study.
