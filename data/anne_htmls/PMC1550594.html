In comparison to a written medical record kept in centralized storage, an Internet-accessible medical record may be particularly helpful for patients. Patients can review an online medical record repeatedly at their convenience, in the context of other resources that may assist them in comprehending it. Demonstration projects have shown that patients can be provided access to online medical records without compromising privacy and security.

Our version, System Providing Patients Access to Records Online (SPPARO), provides access to clinical notes and test results, and also provides a method of sending electronic messages to the clinic staff. We sought to determine whether access to SPPARO would improve patient satisfaction, adherence, and health status.

Because patients with heart failure often require frequent visits and complicated medical regimens, we anticipated that access to medical records would be particularly helpful for these patients, by clarifying their doctors' assessments and instructions. We hypothesized that access to the medical record would improve their self-efficacy, adherence, and satisfaction, and might improve their health status as well.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="10097" xml_f="10104" txt_i="4631" txt_f="4638">Methods</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="10124" xml_f="10131" txt_i="4639" txt_f="4646">Setting</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10142" xml_f="10573" txt_i="4647" txt_f="5078">We conducted the clinical trial in a specialty clinic for patients with heart failure at University of Colorado Hospital in Denver, Colorado.

Likewise, although emergency department utilization was significantly higher in the intervention group, the intervention group did not differ from the control group in hospitalizations or mortality.

There may also have been an initial novelty effect that waned over time. With regard to electronic messaging, we found that electronic messaging did not substitute for phone communication, which is similar to the study by Katz [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22"><offsets xml_i="49070" xml_f="49072" txt_i="30095" txt_f="30097">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49079" xml_f="49081" txt_i="30097" txt_f="30099">].</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49103" xml_f="49127" txt_i="30101" txt_f="30125">Strengths and Weaknesses</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49138" xml_f="50164" txt_i="30126" txt_f="31152">In comparison to previous studies, this study is notable for its rigorous design. By obtaining a participant pool of only those who were interested in online patient-accessible medical records, and randomly assigning exposure status within that pool, we were able to minimize selection bias and maximize internal validity. Nonrandomized studies of interventions using information technology may be particularly prone to selection bias. In our own study, there were clear socioeconomic differences between the participants and the decliners, although their age, gender composition, and health status were not significantly different. Selecting patients with a homogeneous, serious disease process also facilitated the study of outcome measures such as mortality, symptoms, and quality of life (albeit at some cost to the study's generalizability.) The primary weakness of the study was its small sample size, which limited its power to detect effects of the intervention, particularly after the attrition in the first 6 months.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="50186" xml_f="50198" txt_i="31154" txt_f="31166">Implications</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="50209" xml_f="50675" txt_i="31167" txt_f="31633">Overall, this trial suggests that a patient-accessible electronic medical record can be implemented with the potential for a modest benefit in adherence and minimal impact on clinic operations. Although the majority of patients were not interested in online medical records, the fact that fully one-quarter of the patients in the practice were interested demonstrates that this intervention can appeal to a substantial number of patients, demonstrating its "reach" [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23"><offsets xml_i="50709" xml_f="50711" txt_i="31633" txt_f="31635">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="50718" xml_f="51092" txt_i="31635" txt_f="32009">]. However, results may vary in more heterogeneous practices (such as primary care practices). Patients with more acute illnesses, or less severe chronic illnesses, may only access an online medical record sporadically, so the effects of the intervention may be less robust. Providing access to clinical notes that address mental health issues may also be more problematic [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24"><offsets xml_i="51126" xml_f="51128" txt_i="32009" txt_f="32011">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="51135" xml_f="51137" txt_i="32011" txt_f="32013">- </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26"><offsets xml_i="51171" xml_f="51173" txt_i="32013" txt_f="32015">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="51180" xml_f="51183" txt_i="32015" txt_f="32018">] .</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51190" xml_f="51540" txt_i="32019" txt_f="32369">The overall impression from studies of patient-accessible medical records is that they can improve certain aspects of care, but they are unlikely to substantially improve health status.

Future directions in patient-accessible electronic medical records will likely involve integrating educational strategies with behavioral strategies, so the medical record will be presented to patients in formats that are more comprehensible, more useful, and more likely to empower patients to care for themselves.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded through a grant from the Commonwealth Fund, grant number 20010374.
