However, implementation of a vaccination program for adolescents and/or adults would carry a significant cost. Policymakers will need to decide whether or not to recommend use of a vaccine where the health benefits to adolescents and adults are reductions in short-term morbidity, rather than mortality, and the health risks include adverse events from vaccination. Thus, further information regarding the relative valuations by patients of different potential consequences should be considered.

Contingent valuation is an economic approach to valuing different outcomes using monetary value (e.g. willingness-to-pay, WTP) as a common metric; for example, the relative amounts that individuals would pay to avoid one health state or another may be interpreted as measures of their strength of preferences for time spent in these different states. An advantage to this approach is that respondents may find it relatively easy to value short-term health states in monetary terms since they are accustomed to assessing the dollar value of goods and services in everyday transactions. However, some outcomes are difficult to quantify using contingent valuation, e.g. how much a person is willing to pay to avoid death. Additionally, CV may be subject to anchoring effects and income effects [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><offsets xml_i="8798" xml_f="8800" txt_i="4280" txt_f="4282">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8807" xml_f="8809" txt_i="4282" txt_f="4284">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8816" xml_f="9479" txt_i="4285" txt_f="4948">Another common approach to measuring the benefits and harms of health interventions relies on health-state utilities. Utilities measure a person's preferences for specific outcomes on a scale of 0 to 1, on which 0 typically represents a state equivalent to death while 1 represents the best imaginable health. The time trade-off method is one of several approaches used to assess health utilities. Using the TTO method, respondents are asked how much longevity they would be willing to give up, if any, to avoid living with a particular health outcome.

In interval regression, when parents were willing to trade off their full life expectancy to avoid a lifetime health outcome in their child, we treated this observation as providing only partial information about the amount that parents would give up, since they were limited by their life span – which was always shorter than the lifespan of the beneficiary adolescent. These observations were assumed to indicate a range of time spanning between the longevity of the parent and that of the adolescent.

We asked all respondents to imagine they had a 1-month-old infant who developed pertussis that could result in either short-term (8 weeks followed by perfect health) or long-term health states. Mean utilities for short-term infant health states, such as respiratory or neurologic complications due to pertussis, were lower than mean utilities for vaccine adverse events or adolescent/adult disease. However, mean utilities for long-term infant health states were not significantly different from adolescent/adult disease utilities. All respondents were willing to pay significantly more to avoid infant disease compared to vaccine adverse events or adolescent/adult disease. Neurologic disease was considered significantly worse than infant respiratory disease regardless of the method of valuation.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T5"><label><offsets

In other words, asking respondents to give up a few days or weeks from the ends of their lives may not be considered a significant loss, even to avoid a short-duration health state lasting only 8 weeks. However, giving up months or years of life is considerably more difficult for individuals, even to avoid an intermediate- or long-term health state. It may be that a threshold exists whereby individuals are more willing to give up a very small portion of their lives for perfect health, but as the duration of health states increase, they are less willing to give up time per health unit gained, resulting in failure to behave according to the constant proportional trade-off assumption. This aversion to giving up larger amounts of time may play an important role in measuring utilities, particularly since the short duration of these health states over the lifetime of individuals would otherwise lead to nearly imperceptible, but arguably important differences in terms of quality-adjusted life years.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="57030" xml_f="57267" txt_i="36538" txt_f="36775">The impact of discounting is important to consider since assuming no discounting can lead to a downward bias, while a high discount rate can lead to an upward bias, which may strongly devalue the benefits of any preventive intervention [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="57299" xml_f="57301" txt_i="36775" txt_f="36777">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="57308" xml_f="57309" txt_i="36777" txt_f="36778">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41"><offsets xml_i="57341" xml_f="57343" txt_i="36778" txt_f="36780">41</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="57350" xml_f="57351" txt_i="36780" txt_f="36781">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43"><offsets xml_i="57383" xml_f="57385" txt_i="36781" txt_f="36783">43</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="57392" xml_f="58007" txt_i="36783" txt_f="37398">].
