[Methods] Subjects
in both groups received general training five times per week. Subjects in the experimental
group practiced an additional task-oriented training program with WBV, which was performed
for 15 minutes, five times per week, for four weeks. The center of pressure (COP) path
length and average velocity were used to assess subjects static sitting balance, and the
Modified Functional Reach Test (MFRT) was used to assess their dynamic sitting balance.
The paired t-test was performed to test the significance of differences between before and
after the intervention. The independent t-test was conducted to test the significance of
differences between the groups. [Results] Following the intervention, the experimental
group showed a significant change in MFRT. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest
that task-oriented training with WBV is feasible and efficacious for stroke patients.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Whole body vibration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="5485" xml_f="5497" txt_i="1220" txt_f="1232">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5508" xml_f="5572" txt_i="1233" txt_f="1297">Impaired sitting balance is a common problem for stroke patients</offsets><xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="5603" xml_f="5604" txt_i="1297" txt_f="1298">1</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="5616" xml_f="5617" txt_i="1298" txt_f="1299">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="5623" xml_f="5705" txt_i="1299" txt_f="1381">, yet a sitting position is essential for safe execution of a

performing task-oriented training with WBV would show greater improvement of sitting balance
than a control group that performing task-oriented training alone.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title><offsets xml_i="8594" xml_f="8614" txt_i="3297" txt_f="3317">SUBJECTS AND METHODS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8625" xml_f="9700" txt_i="3318" txt_f="4390">The subjects were chronic stroke inpatients of the D Rehabilitation hospital.
