Because there are cognitive and sensorimotor differences in the various phases of a stroke, it was decided to choose one of them, for greater control of the data. This, however, does not preclude the conduct of future studies that compare patients in different stages in order to know at what time after the injury stimulation could be more effective. Furthermore, the treatment will be performed in the laboratory, which can result in losses or withdrawals by participants.
