Since we had an enormous amount of data from the insurance companies at our disposal (about 700 GPs in the centre and south of the Netherlands), it was practically impossible to include them all. The Maastricht region (intervention region, n = 53 GPs) was compared with a random sample of 54 GPs drawn from the remaining GPs (control group). First, however, an randomised controlled trial (RCT) was carried out within the intervention group; 27 GPs were invited for a more intense role in the development procedure and were compared with 26 GPs in a corresponding control group. The inclusion criteria were: completeness of the GPs' data (no missing data per GP for more than one year) and at least 500 patients in the GPs' practice. As the two groups in the RCT turned out to be comparable, we executed the second comparison: we compared the entire Maastricht region with an external control group, selected at random from all the available data. A pre trial power-calculation was not performed; the study concerned a pragmatic trial, where evaluation was planned alongside an intervention being executed anyway. For this study, only GPs who were not already participating in another regional intervention of similar character, were sent the guideline by post and invited to give comments (n = 53 GPs). The GPs in both designs were not aware of the fact that they were in an evaluation study, because only anonymous volume data were collected from an existing database. There was therefore no need for GPs or patients to give informed consent. The asthma/COPD and cholesterol guidelines were disseminated in March 2002. Baseline data were gathered one year before, and follow-up measurements were made one and two years after the dissemination of each guideline.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11122" xml_f="11130" txt_i="6165" txt_f="6173">Strategy</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11141" xml_f="11726" txt_i="6174" txt_f="6759">The guideline topics were chosen by the steering committee, existing of decision-making representatives (pharmacists, GPs, hospital staff and regional insurance company).

First, although unlikely the quasi-experimental design cannot guarantee that the observed changes are the result of the strategy. It is possible that the effects found were caused by coincidence or by an unknown non-specific factor. Although the intervention group in both designs seems to be higher in volumes of prescription at baseline, both groups seem comparable in the exposure to quality improvement strategies that have been performed otherwise in the region. A second issue for consideration is the pragmatic base of the trial in which two regions were compared. This has caused a restriction in the number of GPs in the trial. We were not in the position to improve this. Together with the relatively high variation among the primary variable (volumes of prescription per GP per 1000 patients per year) the power of the study was negatively influenced. Another power calculation executed after ending the study, based on the large standard deviations and the number of GPs, showed that this resulted in a power of 40%. In this study only large differences could be detected. We found a few significant results, although the significant effect of mupirocin is not so interesting because mupirocin is rarely prescribed and the disease is a minor ailment. Given the fact that this study was no selected sample and the participating GPs were a fine representation for the Dutch GPs other results are not expected in larger trials. Besides, when evaluating this intervention in an economic study we wonder if the changes in prescribing behaviour are in balance to such huge efforts made in investment and implementation costs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19843" xml_f="20503" txt_i="14373" txt_f="15033">Only volume data of prescriptions were used in this initial stage of the study. These figures are therefore not linked to any diagnosis. However, some drugs are prescribed for several different medical problems, while the guideline may contain opposing prescription recommendations. For example, amoxicillin is recommended for the treatment of bronchitis and otitis media acuta, whereas amoxicillin is discouraged in cases of acute cystitis. On the one hand, for statin use, there is a situation of overuse for patients with low risk on cardiovascular disease; on the other hand, there is a situation of underuse for high-risk patients like diabetes patients [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="20535" xml_f="20537" txt_i="15033" txt_f="15035">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20544" xml_f="20779" txt_i="15035" txt_f="15270">]. It is therefore possible that the results are somewhat underestimated in the sense that possible results were kept hidden. Additional information about diagnosis and cholesterol rates would be needed to make a more precise analysis.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20786" xml_f="21293" txt_i="15271" txt_f="15778">A strong aspect of our study is that long-term effects were measured. For statin-prescription, the initial non-significant effect appeared to be significant at the long run. A positive factor that may have contributed to an increased willingness to follow the cholesterol medication guideline is that our strategy concerns guidelines that have been formulated by representatives from all disciplines and was intended to improve prescription behaviour in both primary care physicians ánd medical specialists.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21300" xml_f="21754" txt_i="15779" txt_f="16233">Overall, the implementation strategy only generated limited results. Implementation experts indicate that if guidelines are developed by the clinicians who are to use them this will be a positive contributor to the effect of guidelines. Achieving consensus on draft guidelines and creating a sense of 'ownership' through a process of development on several levels (central, local and individual) is essential for successful implementation of guidelines [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="21786" xml_f="21788" txt_i="16233" txt_f="16235">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21795" xml_f="21796" txt_i="16235" txt_f="16236">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="21828" xml_f="21830" txt_i="16236" txt_f="16238">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21837" xml_f="22964" txt_i="16238" txt_f="17365">]. We have paid specific attention to this aspect, firstly by involving representatives from all disciplines in the development of the guidelines. The term intensity is therefore related to the time and energy that was put into the guideline development strategy to create support among GPs. Secondly, we also focused specifically on the doctors' acceptance of the guidelines by including them in the validation procedure. It is not clear why the GPs did not respond to the invitation for comment. Possibly, we were successful in choosing opinion leaders to such extent that GPs did not see the need to comment on guidelines that were prepared by GPs they trusted. A second explanation lies in the assumption that the invitation by mail did not work: only a few GPs responded to the invitation to comment on the guideline. GPs might have had comments but did not think this would have any impact in the final guideline. In short, we did not succeed in getting GPs involved locally in the validation procedure. Apparently this way of getting GPs involved is not appropriate and possibly explains why the effect was only limited.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22971" xml_f="23831" txt_i="17366" txt_f="18226">To create involvement in the validation procedure we searched for a successful method to achieve this. During the validation of the antibiotics guideline we started with visiting PTAMs in the region to get comments on the conceptual guidelines and create involvement. This turned out to be very time consuming and caused much delay in the dissemination of the final guideline. Therefore, during the validation of the asthma and the COPD guideline we chose for a less labour-intensive method by asking GPs to comment by mail. After finishing the analyses for this study, we subsequently started (not included in the data of the manuscript) with inviting GPs to feedback meetings. The results of this method were more convincing. We highly recommend the feedback meetings to be an effective method to create involvement among GPs during the validation procedure.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23838" xml_f="24011" txt_i="18227" txt_f="18400">To obtain a more solid or extensive effect, an additional implementation strategy is desired.

For example, a computerised decision support system could give feedback to a doctor as soon as the prescription behaviour differs from the behaviour recommended in the guideline.

If we were to choose to compare the total expenses of the intensive development procedure of all guidelines with the cost savings, we would expect all the findings to be negative, because the strategy was time and energy consuming and its impact was only moderate.
