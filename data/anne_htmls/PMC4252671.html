The advantages of using shampoo products for treating seborrheic dermatitis are as follows: (i) the detergent eliminates irritants and antigens, such as fungal elements and oxidized sebum; (ii) contact between active ingredients and the scalp can be increased by eliminating waste matter; (iii) water and surfactants loosen the skin barrier, increasing the penetration of active ingredients; and (iv) as the product is rinsed off, the hair does not appear greasy, causing no discomfort in daily life.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15920" xml_f="15974" txt_i="10055" txt_f="10109">Sebum secretion differed according to scalp location (</offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T3"><offsets xml_i="16006" xml_f="16013" txt_i="10109" txt_f="10116">Table 3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16020" xml_f="16757" txt_i="10116" txt_f="10853">). Given that seborrheic dermatitis is more prevalent on the scalp, face, and chest where the sebum secretion level is high, it can be speculated that the frequency of seborrheic dermatitis also varies with the scalp location. The manifestation of symptoms is affected by the composition and quality of sebum, as well as its quantity. Sebum consists of various compounds, including glycerides, wax esters, squalene, cholesterol, cholesterol esters, and free fatty acids, and their composition and quality can readily change during exposure to the external environment.
