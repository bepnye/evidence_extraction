After the monitoring was complete, each session opened with a prayer by one of the participants or the church diabetes advisor (CDA) and an overview of the session's content by the group facilitator.

First, it was challenging to recruit churches into the trial — only 25% of churches contacted agreed to participate, and 20% of those who agreed were not randomized because they did not recruit enough participants, pastors changed their minds about participation, or leadership changed. Some reasons that churches may not have wanted to participate include 1) not wanting to add a new program because of numerous existing outreach efforts (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"><offsets xml_i="36236" xml_f="36238" txt_i="29451" txt_f="29453">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36245" xml_f="37015" txt_i="29453" txt_f="30223">); 2) lack of positive experiences with research participation (with only 22% of our sample having participated in research projects during the last 2 years); and 3) considering diabetes to be a medical condition best handled by health care professionals in a clinical setting. If the church is to play an important role in supporting self-management behaviors for African Americans (within the framework of chronic disease management), then the success of programs such as A New DAWN may increase the community’s awareness of how churches can play a role in improving diabetes care. Second, the role of the CDA in interventions such as A New DAWN will need additional evaluation to assess its potential in facilitating church support systems for patients with diabetes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37022" xml_f="37165" txt_i="30224" txt_f="30367">Participants recruited from churches for A New DAWN differed in important ways from participants in other clinic-based diabetes interventions (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><offsets xml_i="37197" xml_f="37199" txt_i="30367" txt_f="30369">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37206" xml_f="37207" txt_i="30369" txt_f="30370">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"><offsets xml_i="37239" xml_f="37241" txt_i="30370" txt_f="30372">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37248" xml_f="37249" txt_i="30372" txt_f="30373">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40"><offsets xml_i="37281" xml_f="37283" txt_i="30373" txt_f="30375">40</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37290" xml_f="37523" txt_i="30375" txt_f="30608">) conducted in central North Carolina.
