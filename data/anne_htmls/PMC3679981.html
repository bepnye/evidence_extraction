diabetes. In China, an estimated 34.7 percent of people diagnosed with diabetes have renal complications and a further 50 percent die of renal failure. Hence, identification of alternative treatments for these patients should be given priority. The Shenyan Kangfu tablet (SYKFT) is a new formulation of an existing and widely acclaimed Chinese herbal tea for treating qi-yin deficiency syndrome. Because a considerable portion of DN patients presenting with symptoms of swelling, fatigue and weak limbs would be diagnosed with qi-yin deficiency syndrome according to the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnostic criteria, we hypothesize that SYKFT may represent a complementary drug for DN patients with the corresponding syndrome. In view of this, we have designed a trial to assess the efficacy and safety of SYKFT for patients with diabetic nephropathy exhibiting signs of qi and yin deficiency.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6805" xml_f="6812" txt_i="996" txt_f="1003">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6823" xml_f="7564" txt_i="1004" txt_f="1745">This is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The experimental intervention will be SYKFY plus irbesartan (SI regimen) and the control intervention will be a placebo plus irbesartan (PI regimen). Participants will receive two courses of medication treatment each lasting 8 weeks. The primary outcome will be the composite of the quantitative 24-hour urinary protein level and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER). Changes in urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and DN staging, and TCM symptom improvement will be the secondary outcome measures. Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7586" xml_f="7596" txt_i="1747" txt_f="1757">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7607" xml_f="7996" txt_i="1758" txt_f="2147">This study will be the first placebo-controlled RCT to assess whether SYKFT plus irbesartan will have beneficial effects on enhancing overall response rate (ORR), changing DN staging, improving clinical symptoms, and reducing the frequency of AEs for DN patients with qi-yin deficiency syndrome.

SYKFT has been considered for use in DN treatment because DN patients may share the same TCM syndrome and clinical symptoms with nephritis sufferers. For instance, they may both display symptoms of mental and physical fatigue, swollen face and limbs, sore waist and weak limbs or dizziness and tinnitus, and may both present a red tongue with little coating and a sunken and string-like/thready pulse upon TCM tongue and pulse diagnosis. Moreover, patients suffering from both diseases may develop proteinuria and hematuria with the progression of renal insufficiency. Thus we speculate that the effective solution for the treatment of nephritis may play a similar role in the treatment of DN. We will conduct a multicenter, double-blind randomized clinical trial (RCT) of SYKFT in phase III and IV DN patients to test this hypothesis.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="12239" xml_f="12249" txt_i="5674" txt_f="5684">Objectives</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12260" xml_f="12498" txt_i="5685" txt_f="5923">This clinical trial aims to assess whether Shenyan Kangfu tablets combined with irbesartan (SI regimen) is superior to a placebo combined with irbesartan (PI regimen) in efficacy and safety for DN patients with qi-yin deficiency syndrome.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="12545" xml_f="12551" txt_i="5926" txt_f="5932">Method</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="12571" xml_f="12583" txt_i="5933" txt_f="5945">Study design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12594" xml_f="12910" txt_i="5946" txt_f="6262">This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial lasting 16 weeks.
