Patients were recruited sequentially, by specific participating physicians at their clinic visits to three independent hospitals. The diseases in enrolled dental patients included dental caries, periodontal diseases and dental trauma. Renal diseases in recruits included kidney infections, stones and some other conditions. Patients were randomly assigned to receive the "2-minute sciatic nerve press" or the "placebo press". For the "2-minute sciatic nerve press", pressure was applied simultaneously to the sciatic nerves at the back of the thighs, using the fists while patients lay prone. For the "placebo press", pressure was applied simultaneously to a parallel spot on the front of the thighs, using the fists while patients lay supine. Each fist applied a pressure of 11 to 20 kg for 2 minutes, after which, patients arose to rate pain.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4780" xml_f="4787" txt_i="1347" txt_f="1354">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4798" xml_f="5382" txt_i="1355" txt_f="1933">The "2-minute sciatic nerve press" produced greater pain relief than the "placebo press".

In most cases, pain cannot be rapidly relieved. Overcoming pain in a fast and convenient way, therefore, is a worthwhile goal that has yet to be achieved despite considerable research into the subject. Presently, the analgesics available to patients are not satisfactory. For patients with acute initial pain, the time necessary to acquire appropriate pharmaceuticals, as well as, for drugs to reach effective levels, can mean hours or days of sustained pain before relief. Furthermore, many commonly used drugs, both over-the-counter and prescription, have well known serious side effects. For example, commonly prescribed NSAIDs can cause ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding and renal impairment. Opioids can cause, among other things, constipation, nausea, vomiting, sedation, dependency, and addiction [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="6724" xml_f="6725" txt_i="3121" txt_f="3122">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6732" xml_f="6733" txt_i="3122" txt_f="3123">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="6764" xml_f="6765" txt_i="3123" txt_f="3124">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6772" xml_f="6774" txt_i="3124" txt_f="3126">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6781" xml_f="6995" txt_i="3127" txt_f="3341">Many non-drug analgesics have been used to help manage pain: acupuncture, cryoanalgesia, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), interferential stimulation (IFS), exercise, massage, music therapy, etc [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="7026" xml_f="7027" txt_i="3341" txt_f="3342">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7034" xml_f="7035" txt_i="3342" txt_f="3343">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="7066" xml_f="7067" txt_i="3343" txt_f="3344">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7074" xml_f="7423" txt_i="3344" txt_f="3693">].

All the patients were told that the experiments were designed to test whether the method works for pain relief or not. All were advised that they could discontinue the experiment at any time without penalty, and their healthcare treatment would not be affected. After informed consent was obtained, the doctor or his assistant taught the patients how to evaluate pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS), with pain scaled from "0" for no pain to "10" for most pain. Thereafter, randomization of patients to the "sciatic press" group or the "placebo press" group was performed using Random Permuted Blocks. The three steps of the test were described to each patient, including: the baseline pain rating step, the leg pressure step for 2 minutes while lying down and, the post-pressure pain rating step for 10 min. In this context, the '0 minute' point indicated that the pain was estimated within one minute of discontinuing the leg pressure.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10665" xml_f="10814" txt_i="6477" txt_f="6626">The location of the classic 'Chengfu' point, the sciatic nerve pressure area, and the fist gesture for pressure application used are shown in Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="10844" xml_f="10845" txt_i="6626" txt_f="6627">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10852" xml_f="11617" txt_i="6627" txt_f="7392">.

For the "placebo press", the same amount of pressure was applied to a parallel spot on the front of the thighs, while patients lay supine. Doctors, using the gesture shown in the manuscript, pressed repeatedly on a balance to experience and learn how much force to use with each fist. The trained doctors determined how much force to apply based on the patients' body type. The heavily muscled and large body patients receiving greater pressure, (18–20 kg with each fist). Similarly, thin patients received less pressure (11–13 kg each fist).

However, limited by the small number of patients in this study, we can not assert whether the method works less effectively in intense pain states, or, if the loss of effect is related to the diseases' origin, or, to some other factor.

Fists produced better results than finger tips in this method; because, is difficult to apply sufficient pressure for two minutes with finger tips, and, finger tips miss the precise sciatic nerve too easily. Pressure application was two minutes for all patients in this study. In our pilot study, for those patients who obtained pain relief with the method, 25% patients obtained relief within 30 to 60 second of the press, 54.7% patients between 60 to 90 seconds' after the press, and, the rest needed pressure for a longer time. Time shorter than 90 seconds of pressure for the press decreased the rate of success, and, the duration of pain relief declined proportionally. The third qualitative factor of importance is the amount of pressure applied. Insufficient force led to a failure of relief.

These observations suggest possible activation of multiple inhibitory systems. Another mechanism possibly involved is activation of the endogenous opioid system. In studying the effect of low frequency stimulation of rat sciatic nerve on long-lasting cardiovascular depression and pain threshold, Yao found that the pain threshold was increased by 50%.
