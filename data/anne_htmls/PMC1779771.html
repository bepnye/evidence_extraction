However, since initiation of ATP infusions under medical supervision in a clinical setting would facilitate the treatment of possible side effects, the first two ATP infusions were given at the day care center of the participating hospitals.

The QLQ-C30 is a 30-item cancer-specific core questionnaire that addresses various domains of QoL. It contains five functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning and social functioning), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain and nausea/vomiting), two items assessing global health and quality of life, and a number of single items addressing various symptoms (constipation, diarrhoea, dyspnea, anorexia and insomnia) and perceived financial impact. All items are scored on a 4-point Likert-type scale. The content areas covered by this questionnaire reflect the multi-dimensionality of the quality of life construct. The EORTC QLQ has been extensively used for assessing health-related quality of life in patients with a wide range of cancers. Studies in patients with advanced cancer with a short life expectancy showed that the questionnaire was well accepted, with a high completion rate and useful in detecting the effectiveness of palliative treatment over time.
