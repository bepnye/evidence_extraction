The individualized diet (10-day diet cycle) provided in daily portions contained approximately 70% (± 210 kJ) of daily energy requirements, 52 –54% of energy from carbohydrates, 26–29% of energy from fat, 17–21% of energy from protein, and 17–21 g of fiber. To assure sufficient micronutrient content of the diet, participants received a multivitamin supplement daily (Nature Made, Mission Hills, CA). After six weeks energy content of the diet was lowered (420 to 840 kJ/day) to reflect changes in body weight. No restrictions were posed on amounts of energy-free foodssuch as water, coffee (without sugar or milk), diet soft drinks, salt, and pepper. All food items were marked (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack), and foods for each day were packed in thermo-insulated bags. The dinner meals were pre-prepared and only needed to be heated. Each participant received a written daily list of foods at every diet pick-up (4 times a week). Any uneaten foods and any additional foods eaten by the participants were reported on daily sheets collected at food pick up. The study dietitian met with each participant weekly to discuss the diet, resolve any barriers and concerns related to food or specimen collection, and to encourage compliance. Each participant was allowed one or two days (i.e., birthday, holiday) on which additional foods could be eaten.

The sample size was relatively small considering dietary calcium intake level, dairy or nondairy diet source, lactose digestion status, and gender as variables. However, it was a randomized controlled crossover trial with similar numbers of lactose digesters and maldigesters. Secondly, we did not measure fecal calcium but used urinary calcium as a marker of calcium intake. We also did not quantify fecal fat complexes (soaps) as a surrogate to soaponification. Rather, we relied on comparison of fecal fat excretion with low and high dietary calcium intake. Thirdly, 24-h stool samples were collected once per week. However, given constant content and reported intake of energy, macronutrients, and micronutrients including calcium of daily diets prepared by the metabolic kitchen it was reasonable to assume that stool fat content was also not different. Fourthly, the cross-over design was used only for dietary calcium level. Thus, the reason we could not detect the significant difference between non-dairy and dairy diet source could be due to large variability across subjects, constant amount of dietary calcium in respective diets, and possible gender differences. Our results for the effect of diet type or lactose digestion status would require further study.</offsets></p><p id="P41"><offsets xml_i="35459" xml_f="35787" txt_i="27214" txt_f="27542">In summary, we found that during moderate (−30%) energy restriction-induced weight loss a high-Ca diet causes an increase in fecal fat excretion independent of calcium source.
