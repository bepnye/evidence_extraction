However, it is not yet known whether a proprioception exercise (PE) program has better long-term effects on the neuromuscular function of the ankle than a TC program. Ankle function is of special concern to older adults, as failure of this joint can lead to balance problems and increased risk of fall. Hence, we designed the present study to examine the effects of a 16-week TC training program versus 16 weeks of PE on the proprioceptive function and muscle strength of the ankle in elderly subjects. Here, we hypothesized that a TC program would lead to greater improvements in proprioceptive function and muscle strength outcomes than an alternative PE program.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title><offsets xml_i="9914" xml_f="9924" txt_i="4761" txt_f="4771">2.

The exercise protocol emphasized static and dynamic balance exercises, including transitions between differing sensory conditions and functional everyday movements. Each lesson incorporated a similar general plan as follows: (1) 5 min warm-up; (2) 20 min of static balance exercises such as squats (two-leg stance) and one-leg stance; (3) 15 min of dynamic balance exercises such as jogging, sideways walking or running with crossovers, forward walking or running in a zigzag line, or backward walking or running in a zigzag line; (4) 5 min of cool-down. Exercises gradually increased in difficulty and training load over the 16-week training period.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title><offsets xml_i="18191" xml_f="18216" txt_i="12376" txt_f="12401">2.5.
