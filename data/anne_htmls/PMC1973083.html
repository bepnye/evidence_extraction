As the number of CRC survivors increases, so too does the need to develop viable rehabilitation programs to help these survivors return to good health as quickly as possible. Exercise has the potential to address many of the adverse effects of CRC treatment; however, to date, the role of exercise in the rehabilitation of cancer patients immediately after the completion of treatment has received limited research attention. This paper presents the design of a randomised controlled trial which will evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a 12-week supervised aerobic exercise program (ImPACT Program) on the physiological and psychological markers of rehabilitation, in addition to biomarkers of standard haematological outcomes and the IGF axis.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4131" xml_f="4145" txt_i="920" txt_f="934">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4156" xml_f="5060" txt_i="935" txt_f="1839">Forty CRC patients will be recruited through oncology clinics and randomised to an exercise group or a usual care control group.
