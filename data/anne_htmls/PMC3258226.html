One limitation is the loss of MEG data sets of 15 participants after randomization procedure. These dropouts were mostly related to participants' refusal of MEG assessment, poor quality MEG data, and participants' inability to complete the study as a result of deportation due to a denial of asylum by the German authorities. Importantly, these participants did not differ in any clinical variable compared to the study completers. Moreover, none of the participants dropped out of NET treatment voluntarily.

However, we cannot rule out that with a larger sample size we might have found other involved brain areas. Another limitation of this study is that a significant number of patients took antidepressant and neuroleptic medication. However, as there were no differences between treatment groups with respect to intake of medication, pharmacological effects as an alternative explanation for NET induced changes are improbable. While we found a simultaneous reduction in PTSD, depression as well as neuronal indicators of the attentive system, we are not able to interrelate these changes on an individual basis due to our small sample size. Larger trials are needed to test whether the change of the attentive system is causally related to a reduction of PTSD as assumed by our theoretical foundation. Moreover, without an active control condition, we cannot rule out the contribution of unspecific treatment ingredients for the causation of any effects. Finally, based on the results of the present study, we cannot determine whether the cortical activity reflects a specific response towards trauma-related stimuli or towards high arousing aversive pictures in general. As the majority of pictures showed human attacks, war scenes or injuries, most of them might have triggered memories related to the individual traumatic experiences. It remains a challenging task for future investigations to disentangle these responses.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="30705" xml_f="30715" txt_i="21863" txt_f="21873">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="30726" xml_f="31445" txt_i="21874" txt_f="22593">In summary, our findings indicate that Narrative Exposure Therapy causes an increase of parietal cortical activity related to the processing of aversive pictures that can be interpreted as a re-establishment of cortical top-down regulation of attention towards these stimuli. NET seems to induce an improvement in episodic memory retrieval that prevents treated patients from being overwhelmed by their own traumatic memories when confronted with aversive or threatening stimuli. Patients treated with NET are able to rely on more elaborate episodic memory contents. They are therefore enabled to re-appraise the direct danger of the current situation, thereby interrupting their former pathological defensive reaction.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="31486" xml_f="31493" txt_i="22595" txt_f="22602">Methods</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="31513" xml_f="31525" txt_i="22603" txt_f="22615">Participants</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31536" xml_f="32102" txt_i="22616" txt_f="23182">The study was carried out at the Psychological Research and Outpatient Clinic for Refugees at the University of Konstanz.

Treatment adherence was monitored by means of regular supervision.

The autobiography is recorded by the therapist in written form and is corrected and elaborated on each subsequent reading. The therapist writes down the biography and reads it aloud at the beginning of each following session for completion and correction. The aim of the therapy is the reorganization of the generally fragmented report of traumatic experiences into a coherent narrative. During the confrontation with the aversive life events, the therapist asks for current and past emotional, physiological, cognitive, and behavioral reactions, and probes for respective observations. While narrating, the patient is encouraged to relive these emotions.
