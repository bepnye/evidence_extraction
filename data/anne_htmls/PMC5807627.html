It is therefore important to seek measures to enhance the stress management skills of schoolteachers. Each schoolteacher in Japan bears the weight of various responsibilities besides lessons in class, including moral guidance, counseling parents, being an advisor to school clubs after class, participating in activities to enhance educational effects, and preparation of reports. Therefore, teachers often feel distress about various areas, and thus, the mental health of Japanese schoolteachers is lower than that of general workers [</offsets><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8841" xml_f="8842" txt_i="2314" txt_f="2315">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8849" xml_f="8850" txt_i="2315" txt_f="2316">,</offsets><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8883" xml_f="8884" txt_i="2316" txt_f="2317">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8891" xml_f="9195" txt_i="2317" txt_f="2621">].

Because the participants in this study were healthy, their awareness that CBT is useful for work and daily life was key to enhance motivation for education. Therefore, the purpose of including CBT in mental health education of teachers was clearly specified, such that CBT was not used as a treatment for mental illness but as a method of self-care to cope flexibly with various stress factors. The seminar was devised to use concrete examples and avoid technical jargon as far as possible to make the contents readily comprehensible.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20156" xml_f="21559" txt_i="10593" txt_f="11996">Part 2 comprised group training in cognitive restructuring, the core technique of CBT. Cognitive restructuring helps people identify negative thought patterns, understand that these thoughts are ineffective or disruptive, and learn how to think differently by replacing adverse and illogical thoughts with more rational and adaptive types of thinking. In this part, participants learned about cognitive restructuring by recording the following on a worksheet about a recently experienced familiar (benign) situation: context, mood, automatic thinking, evidence, contrary evidence, adaptive thinking, and change of mood. During practice, participants were divided into groups of 5-7 members. In each group, one member described a recently experienced stressful event (a mild one causing no privacy issues) to the other members and his or her mood and automatic thinking at that time. Then, all members of the group considered evidence, contrary evidence, adaptive thinking, etc to practice completing the columns of the worksheet. Finally, each group presented the contents of the worksheet to all participants to share patterns and to ask a CBT specialist questions that arose during the group work to deepen their understanding of cognitive restructuring. At the end of the group training, the Web-based CBT program was introduced to participants so that they could learn how to manipulate the program.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21581" xml_f="21656" txt_i="11998" txt_f="12073">Web-Based Homework Using the Web-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Program</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21667" xml_f="21801" txt_i="12074" txt_f="12208">The homework using the Web-based CBT program lasted for 3 months after the end of the group education.

However, intervention programs used in these studies require a lot of time and continuous involvement of CBT specialists, and are, therefore, difficult to implement in the workplace in many cases. In this regard, recent years have seen the implementation of efficacy studies using a simplified CBT program by Internet, email, or telephone in the occupational field. However, most of these programs required much time to complete or frequent exchange of emails or telephone calls [</offsets><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="49470" xml_f="49472" txt_i="24587" txt_f="24589">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49479" xml_f="49480" txt_i="24589" txt_f="24590">-</offsets><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="49514" xml_f="49516" txt_i="24590" txt_f="24592">37</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49523" xml_f="49875" txt_i="24592" txt_f="24944">]. This study provided a very simple program consisting of 120-min group education and at least 3 sessions of homework (each session required a run-time of about 30 min) based on a simple Web-based CBT program. This was because we gave importance to the feasibility of the program for a greater number of healthy teachers while minimizing harm to work.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49882" xml_f="50276" txt_i="24945" txt_f="25339">In addition, this study used some mechanisms to maintain motivation for training. Because CBT intervention in healthy subjects may be associated with low motivation for intervention, unlike patients who seek treatment, we emphasized to participants that training based on the principles of CBT in group education would be useful for coping with work stress and for improvement of productivity [</offsets><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="50310" xml_f="50312" txt_i="25339" txt_f="25341">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="50319" xml_f="50320" txt_i="25341" txt_f="25342">,</offsets><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="50354" xml_f="50356" txt_i="25342" txt_f="25344">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="50363" xml_f="50480" txt_i="25344" txt_f="25461">].

Therefore, 6 emails from a health nurse to urge completion of homework were designed to be delivered to each participant during the 3 months of homework. Furthermore, to raise the implementation rate, group education was provided during working hours, and homework was made feasible at home as well as in the workplace. Although the implementation rate of homework was not determined in this study, we presume that these mechanisms contributed to improvement of the implementation rate of homework.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="51046" xml_f="51057" txt_i="25966" txt_f="25977">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="51068" xml_f="52544" txt_i="25978" txt_f="27454">This study had some limitations. First, evaluation indices were our original inquiry items. Although validated scales that evaluate psychological stress are present, and a limited number of scales for cognitive flexibility have been proposed, all these scales include many items. For this study, we chose to use simple questionnaire scales at the stage of study planning. Due to this, a 1-item scale was used for each outcome. Second, participants were limited to teachers in a city who were in the fifth year of their career. To increase the general validity of this study, this issue should be studied in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design under wider conditions. Third, homework implementation status was not evaluated. This was aimed at reducing burden on the participants. However, because homework is considered to play an important part in CBT, it would have been desirable if we had analyzed in detail how often the participants performed the simplified CBT program and whether and how closely the number of implemented homework sessions was correlated with the effect of CBT. Fourth, evaluation of outcomes was completed only at 3 months after the completion of intervention. The decision to do this was made at the stage of study planning to reduce burden on the participants. However, longer follow-up would have been desirable, considering that the amount of work varies according to the time of year, and for the purpose of examining the long-term effect.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="52566" xml_f="52577" txt_i="27456" txt_f="27467">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="52588" xml_f="53451" txt_i="27468" txt_f="28331">This study was the first to examine whether an intervention using CBT in teachers would be effective for enhancement of the cognitive flexibility of teachers and alleviation of their subjective distress. The results of this study show that a simple intervention using Web-based CBT enhanced the cognitive flexibility of teachers and alleviated their subjective distress. Because the subjects of this study were busy schoolteachers, the methods of intervention and evaluation were simplified to the maximum possible extent. Therefore, this study had some limitations in its general validity, but it is of major significance that a useful means for stress management of teachers has been proposed. It is desirable that more useful programs using interventions based on CBT be developed and that a number of RCTs be performed to evaluate their effects appropriately.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors express their sincere gratitude to the schoolteachers who participated in this study.
