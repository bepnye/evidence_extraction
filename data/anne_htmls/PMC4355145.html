Once study participants completed the treatment or were switched to oral medications (phase II) or dropped out from the study, new participants could be screened and allocated into the study. The limited clinic capacity resulted in a varying enrolment pace of six to twenty participants per month, instead of four to five per week as planned.It later became clear that in order to meet the service needs of the participants, the clinic could best operate with no more than 85 participants receiving injectable medications per day.

Due to air quality issues requiring construction in the building where the study clinic is placed (an old bank), recruitment was halted for one month to reduce the physical demands on the clinic. Finally, changes in the Provincial PharmaNet recording of all drug prescription practices that would have led to the potential unblinding of clinic health care workers also caused a two month pause to recruitment while the clinical team worked with the authorities to develop a site specific protection feature.

These sessions included a 20 to 30 minute verbal presentation of the study and time for questions. Common discussion topics included eligibility criteria, the duration of treatment and transition planning at the end of the study. Information packages were distributed either at the end of the session or in lieu of; materials included relevant publications from the NAOMI trial, contact information and answers to frequently asked questions.

The purpose of the CAB is to provide guidance and feedback to the SALOME team with respect to accrual, retention, compliance, access, and ethical issues surrounding study.

Strengths included the benefit of the medication and the need for alternative treatments.

Also, some addictions physicians expressed concern over patients leaving successful treatments and binging in street drug in order to qualify for the study.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title><offsets xml_i="22535" xml_f="22554" txt_i="16228" txt_f="16247">Recruitment process</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22565" xml_f="23050" txt_i="16248" txt_f="16733">Since we experienced a combination of positive interest in SALOME as well as opposition, the team prepared the first day of recruitment (December 19, 2011 between 9am and 5pm) taking into account that the number of applicants could be high or low. In addition to opening the recruitment telephone number, recruitment tables were set up at three key agencies serving the target population.

The recruitment telephone number was the primary method for applying to the study after the first day of recruitment. A chronological numbered list of applicants was created and used to determine their processing order. Once an applicant’s number was reached on this list, the applicant was re-contacted. Upon reaching the applicant, the on-file pre-screening checklist was reviewed and the applicant was asked if he or she was still interested in participating. If so, an appointment was made to begin the screening process. If an applicant could not be found, the chronological order of their application was not displaced. For example, candidates who were incarcerated when the team initially contacted them were able to reconnect and begin the screening process upon release.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24105" xml_f="25209" txt_i="17776" txt_f="18880">Screening to the study required a minimum of three appointments, each lasting an hour or longer in duration. There were no costs to participants and at each stage in the screening process candidates were provided a modest stipend for their time amounting to $35 CAD over the three visits (average hourly wage in British Columbia is $10.50 CAD). During the first visit, candidates signed the informed consent, and the process of verifying eligibility criteria was started. At the second screening visit, candidates completed the baseline questionnaires. Candidates meeting criteria up to the end of the second screening visit were scheduled to meet with the study physician for a full medical examination and confirmation of all criteria. This visit was multi-disciplinary and patient centered; candidates were introduced to the health care providers and services available at the clinic (reception, nurses, physicians, psychosocial team) and a psychosocial assessment was completed. This process was effective for screening and providing an orientation to all aspects of the care available at the clinic.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25216" xml_f="25616" txt_i="18881" txt_f="19281">Following the medical examination and confirmation of all criteria, the study physician notified the research team of participant eligibility.

With these partnerships and their vested interest in this, we had the opportunity to establish this groundwork. In addition, the CAB was an important forum for communicating information about arising barriers as well as devising collaborative strategies for overcoming them. Throughout the study, there was open and ongoing communication between the research team and the community.

In an effort to reduce the loss of candidates during the screening stages while maintaining scientific rigor, our procedures aimed to be participant-centered. Overall interactions with candidates were supportive and understanding of the daily struggles applicants had. Most candidates required additional support from the research team or other agencies to, for example, attend the multiple appointments required for screening. Sometimes a team member met candidates at their residence to accompany them to appointments. If the candidate had a social worker or advocate, the research team worked closely with that person to support the candidate throughout the process. The team understood this process as an opportunity to engage candidates not just in the study but also with the health care system, attending to their particular needs and barriers.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33016" xml_f="33623" txt_i="25828" txt_f="26435">Precise estimates regarding how many applicants were needed to reach the planned sample size was difficult to achieve.

Other times, they no longer met the prerequisites, were not interested or were doing well on other treatments. Due to this unpredictability, the research team continued to accept new applications until the final sample size was reached.

In our communication with these applicants, they were informed of their application number, the number we were presently contacting and our best estimate of the time lapse or the likelihood of being contacted before reaching the sample size.

Given that our main strategy for recruitment was based on a strong community engagement plan, it is difficult to determine which of these activities contributed to the overall effectiveness of this strategy. For example, word of mouth was the primary response received when applicants were asked how they heard about the study. With such a response, we are not able to determine if the sample could have been reached, for example, by focusing efforts on information sessions to drug user groups only, without contacting health care workers. Also, the extensive time lapse caused by the external events makes comparison with refusal rates from other RCTs problematic. Nevertheless, it is important to note that approximately one-third of applicants meeting prerequisites were not invited to initiate screening because we were unable to find them or because recruitment ended before their number was reached.
