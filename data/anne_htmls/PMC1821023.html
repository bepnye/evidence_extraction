To ensure that both training groups were equal in terms of injury risk, a stratified randomization was performed. Participants were stratified for current sporting activities status, previous injury, and gender. Based on sporting activities, there are three categories of novice runners. The first category consists of novice runners who already are participating in a sport in which axial load (i.e., running, walking or jumping) is integrated. The second category is formed by novice runners who already are participating in sporting activities without axial load, like swimming and cycling. The third category is formed by novice runners who did not participate in any sporting activities at baseline measurements. In a study by Macera [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="18747" xml_f="18748" txt_i="12658" txt_f="12659">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18755" xml_f="19574" txt_i="12659" txt_f="13475">], a 74% increased risk was found in runners with a positive history of previous injuries. Since it is not clear whether the high rate of re-injury is caused by incomplete healing of a previous injury or a biomechanical problem, a differentiation in time is made. A distinction can be made between no previous injury, sustaining injured in the last 12 months before baseline measurements, and sustaining injured more than 12 months before baseline measurements. Eighteen strata were formed by gender, previous injury (no, 3–12 months and &gt; 12 months) and sporting activities (no, with axial load and without axial load). From each stratum participants were allocated to intervention or control group by drawing a sealed opaque envelope. Each stratum box contained equal numbers of control and intervention envelopes.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19596" xml_f="19612" txt_i="13477" txt_f="13493">Participant flow</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19623" xml_f="19682" txt_i="13494" txt_f="13553">The study design and participants flow are shown in Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="19712" xml_f="19713" txt_i="13553" txt_f="13554">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19720" xml_f="20763" txt_i="13554" txt_f="14597">.

Of 555 persons who visited the UMCG for an initial appointment, 23 were excluded.
