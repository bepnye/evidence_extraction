In that setting, practical dietary education would be given by registered dietitians. Therefore, to develop evidence-based lifestyle education programs by registered dietitians is important. Furthermore, to conduct effective dietary education, an assessment of nutritional intake is important. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is a feasible method for this purpose.

A total of 100 patients will be in each group. That these physicians applied to participate in the study indicated that they were very interested in innovations in the care of patients with T2D and at high risk for T2D. At present in Japan, T2D is managed in the general practice setting. Thus, lifestyle education on diabetes in outpatient clinics has been increasing in Japan. In this setting, GPs and nurses give brief advice on medication management and monitoring of glycemic control, but only a few dietitians are available to offer a diabetes care plan to patients with T2D. Because the success in the treatment of T2D is highly dependent on dietary habits, dietitians can be very helpful to T2D patients in mastering skills for glycemic control. Access to dietitians is easier in a clinical setting than a hospital setting.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23293" xml_f="23414" txt_i="16851" txt_f="16972">There have been studies on lifestyle interventions in T2D in recent years including those with individual randomization [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"><offsets xml_i="23446" xml_f="23448" txt_i="16972" txt_f="16974">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23455" xml_f="23456" txt_i="16974" txt_f="16975">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="23488" xml_f="23490" txt_i="16975" txt_f="16977">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23497" xml_f="23534" txt_i="16977" txt_f="17014">] and cluster randomization designs [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="23566" xml_f="23568" txt_i="17014" txt_f="17016">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23575" xml_f="23576" txt_i="17016" txt_f="17017">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"><offsets xml_i="23608" xml_f="23610" txt_i="17017" txt_f="17019">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23617" xml_f="23785" txt_i="17019" txt_f="17187">].

Furthermore, the assessment sheet with items ranked according to priority helps standardization of advice by registered dietitians. Secondly, only patients were blinded to the groups. In order to avoid selection bias, we asked GPs to recruit all the patients in turn. Furthermore, we used HbA1c as the primary outcome, which is an objective measure.
