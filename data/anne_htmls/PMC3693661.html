In addition to that, Ramadan was in the summer; therefore, our research results might be different compared to those gained in the autumn since fasting periods are different.

Biochemical analysis showed no significant changes. Also, there was a significant elevation of serum potassium levels. The increase in blood urea intensity might be due to an increase in protein catabolism, doing physical activity, or the reduction of blood circulation in kidneys. Some studies reported that the increase of blood urea, which may be due to some physical activities, in fact, stimulates energy consumption and causes reduction in gained energy (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9602R40"><offsets xml_i="37808" xml_f="37810" txt_i="19569" txt_f="19571">40</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37817" xml_f="38209" txt_i="19571" txt_f="19963">). Similarly, when an individual is under physical stress, albumin and urea discharge increases in the body. Physical exercise is one of the elements which can change biochemical factors. Protein increases in the daily diet. Intestine-stomach bleeding, body dehydration, and inadequate liquid consumption are some of the other elements which can increase blood urea level in fasting periods (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9602R40"><offsets xml_i="38246" xml_f="38248" txt_i="19963" txt_f="19965">40</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38255" xml_f="38730" txt_i="19965" txt_f="20440">). In this study, creatinine levels were increased significantly at the end of the Ramadan. Creatinine, which is a dischargeable substance, is mainly produced in the muscles and is a good criterion to check kidneys’ health since if it is not removed from blood by kidneys, its plasma intensity increases. Sometimes, long-term fasting, thirst, and dehydration will gradually increase the amount of creatinine in the body, which its intensity decreases if dehydration is over (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9602R41"><offsets xml_i="38767" xml_f="38769" txt_i="20440" txt_f="20442">41</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38776" xml_f="39632" txt_i="20442" txt_f="21298">). During continual physical exercise, especially in Ramadan, conserving body liquid resources and balancing outer-cell liquid with inter-tissue spaces is crucial. Osmolarity, which is the sign of osmosis activity of all plasma particles, is between 280-295 mili-osmol in one kilogram in mature people. Despite the fact that in our research, osmolarity changes, , in both active and inactive fasting groups, were considered normal, the results indicated that intra-group average changes of osmolarity serum in the active fasting group increased but not significantly. The sensitivity level of Osmosis receptors is about one percent that is due to changes to Osmolarity which can cause the discharge of anti-diuretic hormones and stimulating thirst. Therefore, body liquid change and the amount of outer-cell sodium can make a lot of changes in Osmolarity (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A9602R42"><offsets xml_i="39669" xml_f="39671" txt_i="21298" txt_f="21300">42</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39678" xml_f="40201" txt_i="21300" txt_f="21823">). Osmolarity increase might be due to dehydration and not consuming enough liquids during the day. In long-term fasting, kidneys re-absorb water. With respect to the fact that sodium levels of both active and inactive fasting groups were not changed, and also the fact that osmolarity level is mainly affected by outer-cell sodium, low amounts of osmolarity is justifiable. The limitations of our study included variety of diets, different adaptation responses to fasting and individual differences of female participants.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study is derived from the research project No. 23246, which was supported by the Research Council of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="afn5953" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:</bold> So far, there have been a few and incoherent results about the effects of physical activities.
