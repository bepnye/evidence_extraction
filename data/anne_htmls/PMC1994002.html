Given the correlation of heart failure with age and the rising life expectancy, the prevalence of heart failure continues to increase in the general population. Sympathetic stimulation intensifies with progressive heart failure. The rationale to use β-blockers in individuals with impaired myocardial function is based on experimental evidence supporting the notion that prolonged α- and β-adrenergic stimulation leads to worsening heart failure. Until recently, safety concerns have precluded the use of β-blockers in patients with diabetes and heart failure. However, several large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials such as Metoprolol Randomized Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF) have shown that β-blockers can be safely used in patients with diabetes and heart failure. Moreover, β-blockers significantly improved morbidity and mortality in this population. Based on this evidence, it is now recommended to add β-blockers such as metoprolol CR/XL with an escalating dosage regimen to the treatment of patients with symptomatic heart failure who already are receiving a stable medical regimen including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, vasodilators, or digitalis.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>metoprolol</kwd><kwd>heart failure</kwd><kwd>diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>β-adrenergic blocking agents</kwd><kwd>MERIT-HF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="3812" xml_f="3824" txt_i="1328" txt_f="1340">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3835" xml_f="3917" txt_i="1341" txt_f="1423">The first β-adrenergic receptor antagonist for medical purposes was introduced by </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38"><offsets xml_i="3949" xml_f="3973" txt_i="1423" txt_f="1447">Powell and Slater (1958)</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="3980" xml_f="4061" txt_i="1447" txt_f="1528"> (dichloroisoproterenol), but its use was limited by a partial agonist activity (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26"><offsets xml_i="4093" xml_f="4119" txt_i="1528" txt_f="1554">Hoffman and Lefkowitz 1996</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4126" xml_f="4159" txt_i="1554" txt_f="1587">).

Digitals, angiotensin II inhibitors, or vasodilators could be used alternatively. Left ventricular ejection fraction had to be 35% or lower at study entry. The dosage of medication was titrated every 2 weeks up to the target doses (carvedilol 25 mg twice daily or metoprolol 50 mg twice daily). The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular deaths, non-cardiovascular deaths, and all-cause mortality or all-cause hospital admission. Overall, this study favored carvedilol over metoprolol in terms of allcause and cardiovascular mortality, as well as serious and non-serious adverse events. However, the mortality difference between the metoprolol or carvedilol group in the subgroup of patients with diabetes, which comprised 24% of the patients in either arm, did not reach statistical significance (hazard ratio [HR] 0.85, 95% CI, 0.69–1.06).</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="16710" xml_f="16734" txt_i="12456" txt_f="12480">Comments and conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16745" xml_f="17185" txt_i="12481" txt_f="12921">Many physicians are still hesitant to prescribe β-blockers to patients with diabetes and CHF.

These differences make it more difficult to put the COMET results into perspective. It should be noted, however, that the achieved reduction in heart rate in COMET participants was equivalent in both the metoprolol and carvedilol group, suggesting a comparable degree of β blockade.

However, based on the evidence from large randomized controlled clinical trials showing a significant survival benefit, the use of β blockers in patients with diabetes and CHF should be encouraged. β-blockers should be introduced at a low starting dose, which is 12.5 mg daily for metoprolol CR/XL, in symptomatic patients who already are receiving a stable medical regimen including ACE inhibitors or ARBs and diuretics, or an alternative regimen with vasodilators if neither ACE inhibitors nor ARBs are tolerated. The β-blocker dose should be maximized as tolerated, and a reasonable target dose for metoprolol appears to be 150–200 mg daily based on the MERIT-HF data. Used in this fashion, extended-release preparations of metoprolol can be safely used in patients with diabetes and heart failure to reduce morbidity and mortality.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><citation citation-type="book"><collab>[AHA] American Heart Association</collab><source>Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics – 2005 Update</source><year>2004</year><publisher-loc>Dallas</publisher-loc><publisher-name>AHA</publisher-name></citation></ref><ref id="b2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Almdal</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Scharling</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>The independent effect of type 2 diabetes mellitus on ischemic heart disease, stroke, and death: a population-based study of 13 000 men and women with 20 years of follow-up</article-title><source>Arch Intern Med</source><year>2004</year><volume>164</volume><fpage>1422</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15249351</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amitabh</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Markham</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Metoprolol: A review of its use in chronic heart failure</article-title><source>Drugs</source><year>2000</year><volume>60</volume><fpage>647</fpage><lpage>78</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11030472</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b4"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Antonis</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Hodge</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>Receptor mechanisms in the hyperglycaemic response to adrenaline in man</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>1967</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>1135</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4164792</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arvan</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Singal</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Knapp</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>Subclinical left ventricular abnormalities in young diabetics</article-title><source>Chest</source><year>1988</year><volume>93</volume><fpage>1031</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3359822</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b6"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bakris</surname><given-names>GL</given-names></name><name><surname>Fonseca</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Katholi</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>Metabolic effects of carvedilol vs metoprolol in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension: a randomized, controlled trial</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2004</year><volume>292</volume><fpage>2227</fpage><lpage>36</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15536109</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b7"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>DSH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Diabetic Cardiomyopathy</article-title><source>Diabetes Care</source><year>2003</year><volume>26</volume><fpage>2949</fpage><lpage>50</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14514607</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b8"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>DSH</given-names></name><name><surname>Lukas</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Holdbrook</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>The effect of carvedilol on mortality risk in heart failure patients with diabetes: results of a meta-analysis</article-title><source>Curr Med Res Opin</source><year>2006</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>287</fpage><lpage>96</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16466600</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="b9"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Benfield</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Clissold</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name><name><surname>Brogden</surname><given-names>RN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Metoprolol.
