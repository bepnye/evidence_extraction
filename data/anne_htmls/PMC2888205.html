Conducted by an experienced FM support group facilitator, these 90- to 120-minute sessions presented information on the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of FM. The rationale for FME was to provide education and to control for the effects of being enrolled in a clinical trial and receiving increased attention and social support. Moreover, by providing a minimal intervention, as opposed to a standard care control, we anticipated enhancing retention. The final session of FME presented information on exercise and physical activity, but no specific recommendations or prescription concerning exercise was given. To avoid the possibility that wearing a pedometer would increase their physical activity, FME participants only wore one for the baseline and post-testing assessments.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18269" xml_f="18286" txt_i="12306" txt_f="12323">Outcomes measures</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18297" xml_f="18390" txt_i="12324" txt_f="12417">The following outcome measures were collected at baseline and after the 12-week intervention.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18412" xml_f="18427" txt_i="12419" txt_f="12434">Primary outcome</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18447" xml_f="18474" txt_i="12435" txt_f="12462">Perceived physical function</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18485" xml_f="18706" txt_i="12463" txt_f="12684">Perceived physical function was assessed using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score.

This suggests that, even with the initiation of LPA, people with FM progress only to a relatively low level of physical activity. It is important to note, however, that the trajectory of the mean step count continued to rise over the 12 weeks suggesting that, had the trial continued, their physical activity may have continued to increase. It may be that people with FM require more time to eventually reach physical activity recommendations compared to persons with other chronic conditions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40407" xml_f="41662" txt_i="26254" txt_f="27509">This study has limitations and strengths. First, to minimize attrition and control for the effects of increased attention, participants randomized to the FME group did receive a minimal intervention. Thus, we cannot determine how LPA compares with a traditional no treatment control group. Second, with the exception of BMI, the tender point count and six-minute walk test, the outcomes described herein were derived from self-report and may be influenced by a variety of factors, including those associated with enrollment in a clinical trial. Third, using pedometers to assess LPA is relatively crude and does not quantify other sorts of physical activities that participants may have engaged in such as cycling or water exercise. Fourth, we did not measure muscle strength during the trial so we are unable to determine whether LPA influences strength. Finally, we excluded persons with FM who had other co-morbid conditions such as uncontrolled hypertension or arthritis which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Strengths of this study include the randomized design, a relatively small drop-out rate (13%), the LPA group's adherence to standardized intervention protocol, and the relatively high rates of attendance to the group sessions.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="41684" xml_f="41695" txt_i="27511" txt_f="27522">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="41706" xml_f="42366" txt_i="27523" txt_f="28183">The results of this study suggest that promoting increased physical activity by asking persons with FM to accumulate short bouts of activity throughout the day can markedly increase the average number of steps taken per day and produces clinically relevant reductions in perceived functional deficits and pain. However, the LPA intervention only moved the participants from the sedentary to low physical activity category. This suggests that it is essential to encourage FM patients to increase the duration of their physical activity in ways that do not compromise their ability to sustain the increased level of activity over the intermediate- and long-term.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="42388" xml_f="42401" txt_i="28185" txt_f="28198">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42412" xml_f="42707" txt_i="28199" txt_f="28494">BMI: Body Mass Index; CES-D: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; FIQ: Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire; FM: fibromyalgia; FME: Fibromyalgia Education Control Group; FSS: Fatigue Severity Scale; LPA: lifestyle physical activity; SD: standard deviation; VAS: Visual Analogue Scale.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="42729" xml_f="42748" txt_i="28496" txt_f="28515">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42759" xml_f="43046" txt_i="28516" txt_f="28803">Kevin R.
