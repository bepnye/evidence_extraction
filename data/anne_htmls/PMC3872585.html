A convenience sampling method was applied, as 124 patients, referring to the emergency ward with a renal colic pain complaints were selected. Subjects were randomly assigned into two groups of 62 patients marked as intravenous acetaminophen (1 gr Amp, Authorized by Cobel Darou Co, Iran) and morphine (10 mg Amp, Darou Pakhsh Co, Iran) groups. For the purpose of conducting this research, ethical approval from Research Ethics Committees of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences was obtained. All samples were tended to participate and signed a written informed consent. They included to the study only if they aged 15-80 years and had a weight of 60-80 kg for the purpose of applying fixed dosage of the drugs, which is 0.1 mg/kg for intravenous morphine and 15 mg/kg for intravenous acetaminophen. In addition, patients whose pain was caused merely by renal colic were included to the study. Those subjects who were addicted, allergic to opioids and acetaminophen, those who had received any types of analgesic drugs within previous 6 h, cases of kidney transplantation, patients with known heart failure, liver failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, cases of blindness and physical disabilities who were not able to communicate, excluded from the study. In order to get more accurate data, a history of previous illness, addiction and medication of the patients were evaluated. Once the diagnosis was confirmed by means of urine analysis, ultrasonography and also applying inclusion criteria, patients were randomly allocated into two groups, one by one by using a table of random numbers. In continue, patient's pain was assessed by using a visual analog scale (VAS) ruler, which rates the amount of pain from 0 to 10 based on patient's confession. At the beginning of each shift, two protocols were prepared by a nurse and labeled as Drug A and Drug B. The specified dosage for morphine, based on patient's weight, was 0.1 mg/kg and also 15 mg/kg for acetaminophen. Since the rapid injection of morphine can result in histamine release, therefore it must be infused slowly within 15 min. Moreover, intravenous acetaminophen should be infused slowly as well as morphine. The nurse, who was in charge of infusing a pain reliever, was unaware of the type of drug in each protocol. At the end of the study, types of infused drugs were determined depending upon the date of drug administration. Patient's pain was checked out twice: Exactly before receiving the pain reliever and 30 min later.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10413" xml_f="10606" txt_i="6161" txt_f="6354">All collected data were analyzed by SPSS [PASW statistics 18 software IBM(®)] and statistical tests such as descriptive statistic, Chi-square, ANOVA, independent t-test and logistic regression.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title><offsets xml_i="10659" xml_f="10666" txt_i="6356" txt_f="6363">RESULTS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10677" xml_f="10929" txt_i="6364" txt_f="6616">Results of this study indicate that most of the participants were male.

In both groups, 15 min before the end of anesthesia and 6 h after surgery, 1 g intravenous acetaminophen has been used. Results of this study indicated that the mean pain score in the laparotomy group and laparoscopy group have been 5/5 and 4/5, respectively. Results of this study indicate that acetaminophen as an activator of serotonin and also inhibitor of cyclooxygenase III and nitric oxide can significantly reduce the need for opioids after the surgery. However, injectable acetaminophen has no side-effects and also is well-tolerated. On the other hand, because of its rapid onset, it's a suitable drug for after surgery pain.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10"><offsets xml_i="19992" xml_f="19994" txt_i="14366" txt_f="14368">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20001" xml_f="20002" txt_i="14368" txt_f="14369">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20009" xml_f="20018" txt_i="14370" txt_f="14379">Van Aken </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="20026" xml_f="20031" txt_i="14379" txt_f="14384">et al</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="20040" xml_f="20494" txt_i="14384" txt_f="14838">. conducted a double-blind study with the aim of comparing analgesic effects of 2 g intravenous acetaminophen, 10 mg intramuscular morphine and placebo in patients undergoing third molar surgery.

However, comparing the mean scores between these two groups show that morphine is more effective in reducing pain than intravenous acetaminophen although has more side effects. Hence it can be concluded that intravenous acetaminophen is safer and also effective treatment that can be administered for patients with renal colic. It's an appropriate alternative or supplement for Opioids. It seems that more research is needed in this field to confirm this suggestion.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title><offsets xml_i="21259" xml_f="21269" txt_i="15502" txt_f="15512">CONCLUSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21280" xml_f="21740" txt_i="15513" txt_f="15973">From this research study, we found out that although opioids such as morphine has been approved to be effective in management of renal colic pain, but intravenous acetaminophen can be effective as well, especially with less harmful complications.
