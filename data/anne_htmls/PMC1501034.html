Objective 1 is to define and develop an appropriate model of disclosure; this will be addressed using a multidisciplinary consensus development process. Objective 2 is to identify factors that influence disclosure of diagnosis; a questionnaire based upon theoretical constructs from a range of behavioural theories will be developed and members of old age mental health teams will be surveyed. The analysis will identify those factors that best predict intention to disclose a diagnosis to a person with dementia. Objective 3 is to develop and pilot test a theory-based intervention to promote disclosure of diagnosis that targets attitudes, beliefs and actions most amenable to change. Objective 3 will use the results of Objectives 1&amp;2 to design and pilot test an intervention to improve the process of and increase the proportion of individuals receiving a diagnosis of dementia, for members of old age mental health teams.

First, from an ethical perspective, people with dementia, like other patients, have a right to know their diagnosis.

Indeed, disclosure is less likely in dementia than in other terminal conditions, such as cancer. Earlier disclosure, supported by advocacy groups, allows the opportunity to plan family, financial, legal and long-term care arrangements. Second, many people with dementia want to know their diagnosis or receive more information about their illness [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="7423" xml_f="7424" txt_i="2833" txt_f="2834">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7431" xml_f="7432" txt_i="2834" txt_f="2835">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="7463" xml_f="7464" txt_i="2835" txt_f="2836">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7471" xml_f="7868" txt_i="2836" txt_f="3233">]. Third, disclosure can facilitate decisions about treatment. Whilst this is increasingly important in the advent of therapies to slow disease progression, anecdotal evidence suggests that patients prescribed anti-dementia medication are not inevitably told their diagnosis. The UK Alzheimer's Society Consumer Network has identified issues around early diagnosis and care as research priorities.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7875" xml_f="8221" txt_i="3234" txt_f="3580">It is a consistent finding that changing clinical practice is unpredictable and can be a slow and haphazard process. Over the last decade a considerable body of literature has been published suggesting that a range of interventions (e.g. reminder systems, interactive education) can be effective in changing health care professionals' behaviour [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="8252" xml_f="8253" txt_i="3580" txt_f="3581">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8260" xml_f="8931" txt_i="3581" txt_f="4252">]. However, studies have substantial heterogeneity of interventions used, targeted behaviours, and study settings that make generalising their findings to routine healthcare settings problematic. Moreover, there is no underlying generalisable taxonomy for either research or service settings by which to characterise individuals, settings and interventions. The assumption that clinical practice is a form of human behaviour and can be described in terms of general theories relating to human behaviour offers the basis for a taxonomy for Implementation Research. For example, the effectiveness of interventions may be influenced by factors such as health professionals' </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="8939" xml_f="8947" txt_i="4252" txt_f="4260">beliefs </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="8956" xml_f="8959" txt_i="4260" txt_f="4263">or </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="8967" xml_f="9005" txt_i="4263" txt_f="4301">perceived control over their practice </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="9014" xml_f="9175" txt_i="4301" txt_f="4462">– generalisable concepts that can be used across different contexts.

Third, they all include non-volitional components that assume individuals do not always have complete control over their actions. According to TPB, the strength of a behavioural intention is determined by attitudes towards the behaviour (in this case disclosure), subjective norms based on the perceived views of other individuals or groups (i.e. perceived social pressure); and perceived behavioural control, encompassing beliefs about self-efficacy (the ability to perform an action) and wider environmental factors that facilitate or inhibit performance [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="15173" xml_f="15175" txt_i="9764" txt_f="9766">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15182" xml_f="15261" txt_i="9766" txt_f="9845">].

In these modelling experiments, elements of an intervention are manipulated within a randomised controlled design in a manner that simulates a real situation as much as possible. Interim endpoints (stated behavioural intention and simulation) are measured rather than changes in professional behaviour or healthcare outcome. This novel approach offers experimental control and the opportunity to vary elements of an intervention in order to better understand intervening variables and the effect on different outcomes. Behavioural intention has been incorporated into virtually all models of health behaviour as the single best predictor of subsequent health behaviour. In a review of 10 meta-analyses Sheeran demonstrated a consistent relationship between behavioural intention and subsequent behaviour, with intention explaining 28% of the variance in behaviour [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"><offsets xml_i="23688" xml_f="23690" txt_i="16949" txt_f="16951">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23697" xml_f="25042" txt_i="16951" txt_f="18296">]. Members of MHTs will receive (or will have received) an initial survey as in Objective 2. Responders to this will be randomly allocated by team to receive one of up to three simulated interventions or a no intervention control. They will be instructed to open the intervention materials and then to complete a further theory-based survey as in Objective 2. Thus, we will identify the method that is most effective at changing professionals' beliefs and intentions. The sample size for a four-armed trial, powered to detect a difference between any two arms, is based upon the following assumptions: MHT as the unit of analysis, the outcome variable in the form of a score for the team, 80% power, and a type 1 error rate of 2.5% (rather than 5% to allow for multiple comparisons). Furthermore, we are aiming to detect a relatively large effect size of 0.8 on the basis that the modelling experiment eliminates some of the sources of variability associated with a 'definitive trial' (e.g. patient characteristics), and any smaller modelling effect size is unlikely to translate into a worthwhile effect in the definitive trial. Hence, we require four groups of 30 teams (120 in total).
