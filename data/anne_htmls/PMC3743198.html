First, this study was a nonrandomized, single center study. Also, we compared the two patient groups on a historical basis, and our sample size was too small for sufficient statistical power to assess all end points. Additionally, we could not evaluate whether or not our standardization procedure had any effect on morbidity and mortality. Therefore, our findings should be cautiously interpreted if considering similar implementation in other institutions. Second, we did not modify the diagnostic process outside the ED because our protocol was focused on ED evaluation. Hence, use of additional diagnostic tests was not strictly controlled. Further studies must be conducted after the adoption of a hospital-wide standardized protocol at our institution. Third, the approaches we used in our study might not be optimal and did not completely reflect the current guidelines, as we modified the guidelines to suit our hospital. For instance, basic blood tests and chest radiographs were conducted solely to prevent malpractice lawsuits, even when not clinically indicated. Fourth, we are unable to exclude the possibility that our findings resulted from a Hawthorne effect during the study period.
