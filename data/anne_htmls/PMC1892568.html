Because of these possibilities, the results of the PCP preferences survey have been incorporated into routine SEACAP support team procedures. Preference information is entered into the support team's database. When a particular patient record is accessed, the preferences of his or her PCP are shown on the same screen, and this information is used to guide interactions with the PCP.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17896" xml_f="18479" txt_i="11929" txt_f="12512">However, there may be potential downsides to using an individualized approach to collaborative support team communications with clinicians. If not designed and delivered carefully, an individualized communication plan could increase the likelihood of deviation from a standardized, evidence-based treatment algorithm. Loss of efficiency might arise from a support team having to develop multiple communication pathways. Clearly, more study is needed of the impact of individualized collaborative care communication approaches on clinician satisfaction and intervention effectiveness.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18486" xml_f="18637" txt_i="12513" txt_f="12664">Finally, guideline-level care is challenging to implement in clinical settings, and lack of clinician motivation and buy-in can be important barriers [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="18669" xml_f="18671" txt_i="12664" txt_f="12666">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18678" xml_f="18679" txt_i="12666" txt_f="12667">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="18711" xml_f="18713" txt_i="12667" txt_f="12669">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18720" xml_f="18721" txt_i="12669" txt_f="12670">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="18753" xml_f="18755" txt_i="12670" txt_f="12672">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18762" xml_f="19308" txt_i="12672" txt_f="13218">].

Although most PCPs indicate a desire for support team members to proceed with assessment and treatment without their preliminary input, a minority of PCPs want more direct involvement in treatment. Finally, the relationships between clinician and practice characteristics, and the effects of incorporating clinician preferences into intervention design and implementation, need to be studied further.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20634" xml_f="20653" txt_i="14410" txt_f="14429">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20664" xml_f="20724" txt_i="14430" txt_f="14490">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20746" xml_f="20768" txt_i="14492" txt_f="14514">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20779" xml_f="21334" txt_i="14515" txt_f="15070">SD was the primary author, contributed to study design, and confirmed the results.
