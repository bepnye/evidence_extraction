Given the small size of the house, the number of people in one household (an average of six), and the heat in the house, some members of a household opt to sleep outside the house. Sleeping outside the house makes it rather difficult to use bed nets despite the fact that it puts the victims at high risk of mosquito bites. Like in many refugee camps and other poor communities, many of the households in the Dadaab refugee camps do not have beds and most of the few that have mostly have one bed which in many cases is improvised in that it is an elevation from the ground using earth.

The samples were taken by field staff who had been trained as auxiliary nurses by MSF. The blood samples were stained with Giemsa and analysed using a light microscope.

The collection of mosquitoes was done by field staff from vector and pest control unit in Care-Refugee assistance project (Care-RAP). Analysis of the mosquitoes was done with assistance of an entomologist from the vector and pest control unit, Care-RAP. Mouthparts were used to identify the species and sex of the mosquitoes. The status of the mosquito, whether engorged or not was established. Identification was done by help of a dissecting microscope. Participants were observed during the follow-up period for side effects including reactions to the skin, effect on the respiratory system or any complaints/symptoms.

The Odds Ratio changed to 0.30 (P = 0.002), thus the odds of being infected with malaria was reduced by 70 percent if possession of nets was controlled indicating that since the comparison block had a higher possession of nets, the nets offered them some protection, therefore, reducing the overall calculated effect slightly when possession of nets was not controlled.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36816" xml_f="37324" txt_i="25299" txt_f="25804">In the third model, several characteristics including possession of nets, sex, age, use of other malaria control methods and sleeping outside were added to the model.

ITNs are expensive and often impractical for some communities for example refuges, pastoral communities, communities in hot climates and the poor. Despite the fact that use of nets deter mosquitoes from entering the houses and reduces mosquito bites, research has shown that some people who report having nets in the households do not use them, for example, in the 1992 Malawi National Survey, only about 66 percent of households with nets reported that they had been used the previous night [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="42667" xml_f="42669" txt_i="30587" txt_f="30589">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42676" xml_f="43106" txt_i="30589" txt_f="31019">]. Even when people report that they use the nets, studies that have included night visits have shown that the reported use is usually higher than the actual use. In one efficacy trial in western Kenya, 85 percent of people with nets claimed to use them regularly, but night visits indicated a use rate of about 70–73 percent during the dry season. Non-users said either that they had "forgotten" or that it was too hot for nets [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"><offsets xml_i="43138" xml_f="43140" txt_i="31019" txt_f="31021">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43147" xml_f="43548" txt_i="31021" txt_f="31422">]. Possible non-compliance to use of nets for those who possess them may explain why the results showed that possession of nets did not significantly affect malaria status in the current study.

This could be a further explanation why nets in this community did not significantly protect the owners since a large proportion of the study participants were reported as sometimes sleeping outside the house especially when it was too hot in the house while many young men in this community sat outside till wee hours of the night chewing "miraa" (khat).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43954" xml_f="46068" txt_i="31783" txt_f="33897">In the current study, despite the fact that the region where Dadaab refugee camps are located has low risk of malaria generally, the risk of malaria infection at the camps may be higher than in the surrounding areas because of poor sanitary practices at the camps. The refugees in Dadaab fetch water from communal taps located at several positions in the camps. Water spilled at the tap-stands contributes a lot in breeding of mosquitoes in the refugee camps. The overall percentage of those infected with malaria parasites before the intervention was low compared to the months after the intervention. This could be explained by the season preceding the start of the study, which was quite dry. By the time the first post-intervention data was collected, the rains had somehow stopped but there were water pools still lying about. During this period, the indoor mosquito densities in the comparison group increased as compared to the pre-intervention densities. This could be due to weather changes: mosquitoes bred in the water pools formed by the rains because though the rains had stopped, the flat terrain and poor drainage of the area encouraged persistence of the water pools and, thus, mosquito breeding. If nature was left to take its own course, the same would have been expected to happen in the comparison group. However, the densities in the treatment group decreased as compared to the pre-intervention period. This could be explained by the intervention given to this group because as expected with permethrin, most mosquitoes coming to the house were either repelled by the ITCs or were knocked down. Accordingly, there were fewer blood-fed mosquitoes in the treatment group as compared to the comparison group (though difference not significant). For the comparison group, this could be explained by the fact that mosquito breeding had increased following the rains. During the second post-intervention data collection, the rains had stopped and the water pools formed by the rains had somehow dried up. Most breeding of mosquitoes was happening at the tap-stand spillage and at pit latrines (for </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="46076" xml_f="46085" txt_i="33897" txt_f="33906">Culicine </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="46094" xml_f="46146" txt_i="33906" txt_f="33958">mosquitoes).

In the current study, the cost benefit analysis were not done but in the Afghan study, the cost of permethrin treatment per person protected (US$ 0.17) was similar to that of treating bed nets and cost only 10–20 percent of the price of a new bed net [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="46758" xml_f="46760" txt_i="34498" txt_f="34500">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46767" xml_f="47894" txt_i="34500" txt_f="35627">]. This points out to the affordability of the strategy to the vulnerable groups and with the fact that this strategy does not require people to change their sleeping patterns like bed nets do, the possibility of its sustainability may be high. This indicates that where nets are unavailable the importance of this strategy cannot be overemphasized and where nets are not adequate, this strategy could be employed as a complement to the use of nets. Despite the potential of using insecticide treated clothes in malaria transmission especially in vulnerable communities, they have not been marketed as much as the more expensive and less appropriate mosquito nets in the vulnerable communities. Social marketing has mainly been targeted to mosquito nets and many governments in the developing countries, Kenya being a good example have shown commitment of promoting net use. For example in Kenya, according to the national malaria control strategy, the goal is to have 60 percent of households use nets by 2006. Unfortunately, such targets are usually to households and not to individuals due to the cost of providing the nets.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47901" xml_f="48104" txt_i="35628" txt_f="35831">Notwithstanding the findings on the potentiality of ITCs in malaria infection control in this study, further research requires to be done to assess cost-effectiveness and sustainability of this strategy.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="48126" xml_f="48136" txt_i="35833" txt_f="35843">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48147" xml_f="49123" txt_i="35844" txt_f="36820">It was concluded that use of ITCs reduces mosquito densities in the house and the rate of infection with malaria parasites. The reduction in the nuisance caused by mosquito bites cannot be overemphasized. It is recommended that this strategy be considered for use in the control of malaria and nuisance caused by mosquito bites in vulnerable communities like poor communities living in slum areas as poor people are less likely to afford ITNs, and if they do, they may not afford enough ITNS to cater for the whole household and in such a circumstance, ITCs could complement the ITNs. The strategy is also recommended for refugee communities especially during emergencies like during influx of refugees to a malaria-prone region as some refugees may not have immunity to malaria. However, a larger scale study for a longer period to traverse different seasons and to determine sustainability and possibly cost-effectiveness of the strategy in a community set up is worthwhile.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49145" xml_f="49167" txt_i="36822" txt_f="36844">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49178" xml_f="49692" txt_i="36845" txt_f="37359">KEW conceived and designed the study, collected and analysed the data, drafted the manuscript and gave final approval for publishing.
