For example, participants learned the guidelines for effective goal setting, defined barriers, brainstormed a list of barriers and strategies to overcome barriers.

To reinforce these skills, GMCB participants were encouraged to practice the skills learned in the cognitive-behavioral training session in order to complete home-based physical activity assignments devised through participant-interventionist collaboration. To avoid ongoing group dependency and encourage the practice of self-regulatory behavior while participants were in the program, increasingly greater self-regulation was practiced each week. The GMCB group focused on gradually weaning participants from dependency on the instructor and on the group program toward independent self-regulation of home-based physical activity.

Future research might attempt to conduct a longer investigation that spans the entire post natal period. As this phase is characterized by multiple, unpredictable obstacles that could potentially limit participation in physical activity, it would be important to determine if the positive effects demonstrated in this preliminary intervention could be maintained by mothers as they move beyond the post natal period to continue child-rearing.
