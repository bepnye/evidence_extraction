Three additional tablets were dispensed for the subjects to take on their own (1 each day for 3 days). Subjects then returned to the clinic site the day following the final naltrexone dose. Subjects who tolerated the oral naltrexone were eligible to participate in the study. The rationale for an oral naltrexone run-in was to avoid exposing naltrexone intolerant individuals to Naltrexone Depot, which once it is given cannot be removed. Eligible subjects received 2 intramuscular injections of 150 mg of Naltrexone Depot, one in each buttock, for a total dose of 300 mg.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17015" xml_f="17269" txt_i="11449" txt_f="11703">Subjects then received brief counseling following their injection and at each weekly study visit throughout the 6-week trial.

The lack of a placebo group makes it difficult to assess the contribution of Naltrexone Depot to the reduction in drinking. Nonetheless, the results from this open-label study are encouraging and warrant further evaluation of Naltrexone Depot as a treatment option for alcohol dependent patients.
