Following this distraction, the patient was positioned in a side-lying posture, and positioned for a low back adjustment (superior leg and hip flexed) without joint slack taken up. This position was held for a few moments, and the chiropractor contacted the soft tissues overlying the gluteal region and administered a light (non-therapeutic) impulse.

We tested two discriminatory points by establishing benchmarks at 6 degrees and 10 degrees. Failure was deemed as a progression of at least 6 degrees or at least 10 degrees, and success was deemed as curve improvement of at least 6 degrees or at least 10 degrees. For the 6 degree benchmark, the standard medical care group had no curves that achieved success and one curve that was rated as a failure; the standard medical care plus sham manipulation patient had both curves rated as failures; and the standard medical care plus chiropractic manipulation group had no curves that achieved failure and one curve that was rated as a success. For the 10 degree benchmark, the standard medical care group had no curves that achieved success or failure; the standard medical care plus sham manipulation patient had one curve rated as failure; and the standard medical care plus chiropractic manipulation group had no curves that achieved failure and one curve that was rated as a success. Chiropractic manipulation was delivered on 52 visits and resulted in two benign reactions. One reaction with a moderate amount of pain lasted for 24 hours; the other produced mild pain lasting 6 hours. Neither reaction reduced the normal activities of the patients. All patients meet the established compliance standards. The patient in the sham group thought she probably had real treatment. Whereas, the chiropractic treatment patients thought their treatment was definitely real or possibly real.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label><offsets xml_i="34847" xml_f="34854"

Our patient population, adolescents, are commonly known to have busy schedules, and it is speculated that potential participants and families did not want to invest 6 months of time with the possibility of receiving placebo treatment. Forthcoming recruitment efforts will need to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of a sham arm.

In post study meetings with treating chiropractors, orthopedic surgeons and research investigators, strategies to improve future protocols were discussed. These strategies included the following: 1) The need for more chiropractic treatment centers located near potential patients, so we can offer a wider geographic catchment; 2) The need to provide our treating chiropractors with a brief review of the study protocols immediately before practitioners meet their first research patient, so the protocols are easier for our treating practitioners to use with a first patient; 3) The need to modify our inclusion criteria to accept patients aged 8 to 14 years with a Risser of 0 or 1, so that our group is more likely to be homogenous and to have a progression of the curves; 4) The need to modify the treatment schedule to 3 months of active treatment with once-a-month follow-ups, so we can improve patient recruitment; 5) The need to measure both cost-effectiveness and brace compliance; 6) The need to use a follow-up period of at least four years [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"><offsets xml_i="49278" xml_f="49280" txt_i="33052" txt_f="33054">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49287" xml_f="49289" txt_i="33054" txt_f="33056">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49296" xml_f="50076" txt_i="33057" txt_f="33837">The development, implementation and successful completion of a large randomized controlled trial would necessitate cooperation among chiropractors and orthopedic specialists, culturally divergent health professionals.
