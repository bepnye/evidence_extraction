Improvements in pain and quality of life measures have been achieved using a multidisciplinary cognitive behavioural therapy pain management programme (CBT-PMP) that aims to recondition attitudes to pain, and improve patients' self-management of their condition. Despite its high prevalence in patients with chronic pain, there is very limited objective evidence for the effect of this intervention on sleep quality. The primary research objective is to investigate the short-term effect of a multidisciplinary CBT-PMP on subjective (measured by Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index) and objective sleep quality (measured by Actigraphy) in patients with chronic pain by comparison with a control group. The secondary objectives will investigate changes in function and mood, and then explore the relationship between objective and subjective sleep quality and physical and psychological outcome measures.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5314" xml_f="5328" txt_i="1052" txt_f="1066">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5339" xml_f="6963" txt_i="1067" txt_f="2688">Patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria for attendance on the multidisciplinary CBT-PMP in the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Tallaght, Dublin and are currently listed on the PMP waiting list will be invited to participate in this pilot study. Potential patients will be screened for sleep disturbance [determined by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)]. Those patients with a sleep disturbance (PSQI &gt;5) will be assigned to either the intervention group (immediate treatment), or control group (deferred treatment, i.e. the PMP they are listed for is more than six months away) based on where they appear on the waiting list. Baseline measures of sleep, function, and mood will be obtained using a combination of self-report questionnaires (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Short Form 36 health survey, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia), and functional outcome measures. Sleep will be measured for seven days using actigraphy (Actiwatch 7). These measures will be repeated after the four week multidisciplinary cognitive behavioural therapy pain management programme, and at a two month follow-up. The waiting list control group will be assessed at baseline, and two months later. Analysis for the primary outcome will include between group differences of subjective and objective sleep parameters from baseline to follow-up using Independent T-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests. The secondary outcomes establishing relationships between the sleep variables and physical and psychological outcome measures will be established using multiple linear regression models.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6985" xml_f="6995" txt_i="2690" txt_f="2700">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7006" xml_f="7209" txt_i="2701" txt_f="2904">This pilot study will evaluate the impact of a multidisciplinary CBT-PMP on both subjective and objective measures of sleep in patients with chronic pain and provide guidance for a larger clinical trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7231" xml_f="7249" txt_i="2906" txt_f="2924">Trial Registration</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7260" xml_f="7293" txt_i="2925" txt_f="2958">Current controlled trial ISRCTN: </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN74913595"><offsets xml_i="7384" xml_f="7398" txt_i="2958" txt_f="2972">ISRCTN74913595</offsets></ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7471" xml_f="7481" txt_i="2981" txt_f="2991">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7492" xml_f="7684" txt_i="2992" txt_f="3184">Chronic pain is a common disorder affecting 19% of the European population.
