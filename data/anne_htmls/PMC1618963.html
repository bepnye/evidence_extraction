Three dissociative anaesthetic protocols were evaluated during castration of colts in an animal hospital. The protocol considered to be the most suitable was thereafter evaluated during castration of colts under field conditions. Respiratory and haemodynamic parameters and the response to surgery were determined during anaesthesia. All horses breathed air spontaneously during anaesthesia. Under hospital conditions 26 colts were randomised to receive one of three anaesthetic protocols: Romifidine and tiletamine-zolazepam (RZ); acepromazine, romifidine and tiletamine-zolazepam (ARZ); or acepromazine, romifidine, butorphanol and tiletamine-zolazepam (ARBZ). The surgeon was blinded to the anaesthetic protocol used and decided whether supplemental anaesthesia was needed to complete surgery. Under field conditions 31 colts were castrated during anaesthesia with the ARBZ protocol. All inductions, anaesthesia and recoveries were calm and without excitation under both hospital and field conditions. Surgery was performed within 5–20 minutes after the horses had assumed lateral recumbency during both hospital and field castrations. Under hospital conditions some horses needed supplemental anaesthesia with all three anaesthetic protocols to complete surgery. Interestingly, none of the horses castrated with protocol ARBZ under field conditions needed additional anaesthesia. Cardiorespiratory changes were within acceptable limits in these clinically healthy colts.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Intravenous dissociative anaesthesia</kwd><kwd>field conditions</kwd><kwd>horse</kwd><kwd>mixed venous oxygen tension</kwd><kwd>jugular venous oxygen tension</kwd><kwd>castration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4014" xml_f="4026" txt_i="1615" txt_f="1627">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4037" xml_f="4350" txt_i="1628" txt_f="1941">Anaesthesia studies often concern cardiorespiratory conditions in healthy horses not subjected to surgery and there have been few reports on cardiovascular data obtained during anaesthesia in clinical cases in field practise.

Clinical examination was performed on all horses. An infusion catheter (14G, Intranule, Vygone, Ecouen, France) was placed in the left jugular vein in the standing horse. Before induction, pads of cotton wool were placed in the horse's ears to reduce external stimuli. During induction one person held the halter and one person held the tail or a tail rope in order to balance the horse and prevent it from falling forwards. After induction the horse was left undisturbed in lateral recumbency for one minute. The horse's head and neck were extended to help to maintain a patent airway. An endotracheal tube was always available, but no horse was intubated and all breathed air spontaneously. The eyes were protected from light with a piece of cloth. The horse was placed in dorso-lateral recumbency for surgery with the chest mainly in the lateral position and the hindquarters more in a dorsal position. Each hind leg was held with a rope or supported with straw bales, a safety precaution that also keeps the horse in balance and gives the surgeon access to the surgical area. When surgery was completed, the horse was returned to lateral recumbency and the lower limbs were pulled forward. The ear pads were removed at approximately 45 minutes after induction. The horses were never forced to stand. When the horse attempted to stand under field conditions, one person held the halter and another person held the tail. The respiratory and heart rates were measured in all horses before sedation (Baseline), 5, 15, 25 and 35 minutes after induction of anaesthesia, and 5 minutes after the horse returned to a standing position (Post).

All horses stood at the first attempt except one horse, which made four calm attempts to stand before standing successfully. For recovery the median score was 3 for all three groups, with a range of 2–3 in the RZ group, 0–3 in the ARZ group and 2–3 in the ARBZ group. The time spent in lateral recumbency was 48 (18) minutes in RZ, 52 (7) minutes in ARZ and 61 (13) minutes in ARBZ. The time from induction until standing again was 58 (24) minutes in RZ, 74 (22) minutes in ARZ and 73(18) minutes in ARBZ. One horse in the ARZ group that had received 1.2 mg/kg thiopentone after 17 minutes of anaesthesia was very tired during recovery and received a score of 0 for recovery. Seventy minutes after induction this horse turned from the lateral to the sternal position several times. After 99 minutes the horse was resting steadily in sternal recumbency and after 133 minutes it was encourage to stand.

No other significant differences in cardiorespiratory parameters were found between the procedures carried out under field conditions and those in the animal hospital. Under field conditions the respiratory rate increased at 25 and 35 minutes of anaesthesia compared to baseline. The mean arterial blood pressure was stable during anaesthesia. The median score for reaction to surgery was 5 for both testes, and the median score was 3 for quality of induction, anaesthesia and recovery, with a range of 1–3. All horses reached a standing position at the first attempt, except the draft horse, which made a frog-like jump before standing successfully. The induction time was 41 (13) seconds, the time spent in lateral recumbency was 49 (11) minutes and the time from induction until standing was 55 (12) minutes.

As 22% of the horses needed further anaesthesia when this protocol was used at the animal hospital, it might have been expected that approximately 7 of the 31 colts castrated under field conditions would need supplemental anesthesia. However, none of the 31 colts castrated in the field needed supplemental anaesthesia (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="42097" xml_f="42098" txt_i="27717" txt_f="27718">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42105" xml_f="43005" txt_i="27718" txt_f="28618">).

The colts had previously been transported to the animal hospital, some for the first time. In this new environment they were placed in boxes within sight and hearing distance of other, unknown colts. These environmental changes may have induced a flight-fight response in the horses. Under field conditions the colts were kept in their own environment and together with colts of their own known herd, where a hierarchy was already established. The novelty stimuli during field castration were less pronounced than during the procedure at the animal hospital.

In the present investigation anaesthesia and analgesia were sufficient for clamping of the second spermatic cord at 12.5 minutes after induction, which also allowed less experienced surgeons enough time to perform the castration procedure under field conditions. However, veterinarians planning to use this anaesthetic protocol in field practice must take into consideration the individual variation of time spent in lateral recumbency, in this study 30–70 minutes. The time from completion of surgery to return of the horse to standing position was sometimes unnecessarily long. Other drug combinations and/or other proportions of dissociative anaesthetic and benzodiazepine might result in anaesthesia sufficient for castration and with a shorter recovery time.

The cardiorespiratory changes were within acceptable limits in these clinically healthy colts. Under hospital conditions some horses from all three anaesthetic protocols needed supplemental anaesthesia to complete surgery. The most interesting finding in the present study was the more pronounced reaction to surgery and need of supplemental anaesthesia under hospital conditions compared to field conditions. This aspect needs further investigation. Perhaps the hospital environment as such induces a high sympathetic tone in the horse which may contribute to the high mortality rate seen in horses during anaesthesia.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Anna Edner, Ann-Marie Ekesten, Karin Morgan and Karin Thulin for excellent assistance.
