Central to our proposed intervention is an enhanced referral into mental health services. No study to date has compared an enhanced referral for specialty mental health services to a simple referral in children who screen positive for mental health problems in the emergency department setting. We were interested in testing whether an enhanced referral (i.e. easy access to a mental health evaluation and encouragement to go) would improve engagement into services for those youth with previously unrecognized mental health problems. Specifically, we were interested in whether, compared to simply giving a phone number for follow up, families in the enhanced intervention would complete the mental health follow-up plan more frequently. We also explored the barriers for not completing the follow up evaluation once a child screened positive for a mental health problem.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="8424" xml_f="8431" txt_i="4627" txt_f="4634">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8442" xml_f="8834" txt_i="4635" txt_f="5027">We conducted a prospective randomized control comparison of an enhanced referral compared to a simple referral into mental health services for children who screened positive for a mental health problem.

The enhanced referral included a brief description of the mental health problem found and the importance of following through on the mental health follow-up. For example, if the child screened positive for depression, the research assistant would explain that "Your child screened positive for symptoms of depression, or feeling blue. Although this is a preliminary screen, it is important for your child to follow up with our mental health expert to see if this is really a problem for her. Not treating a child with depression can lead to problems at home, with friends and at school". A follow-up mental health appointment to the study psychiatrist (S.D.) was made for the family and a reminder phone call was made the day before and the day of the scheduled visit. The comparison group received the number to the same psychiatrist without a scheduled appointment or pre-visit phone reminder. Both groups were told that the comprehensive follow up evaluation would be timely and would not be charged to the family, thus taking access and payment barriers out of the reasons for non-engagement. All patients were given an evaluation within 1–2 weeks of the original visit (or for comparison families within 1–2 weeks of when they called the study psychiatrist for follow-up). Comparison families had the same ease of access into services compared to intervention families once they called the intake number.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="13421" xml_f="13445" txt_i="9254" txt_f="9278">Measurement of disorders</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="13456" xml_f="13572" txt_i="9279" txt_f="9395">Children ages 4–18 and their parents were given the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Child Predictive Scale (DPS) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="13604" xml_f="13606" txt_i="9395" txt_f="9397">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13613" xml_f="13809" txt_i="9397" txt_f="9593">] which uses the methodology of self-report questionnaires as a first stage assessment prior to second stage diagnostic evaluations.

Access and financial barriers to the initial mental health evaluation were intentionally taken out of the equation by the study's design. Both groups had equal access to the study psychiatrist once the follow-up number was called however only ten percent of families with a child who screened positive for a mental health problem followed up for an evaluation. This represents a serious gap in mental health service delivery for those families at highest risk for unmet mental health needs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23435" xml_f="24008" txt_i="16606" txt_f="17179">The lack of engagement effect of the intervention may have been related to the limited scope of the enhanced referral and the use of a research assistant instead of a seasoned provider. Although the potential engagement barrier of access was removed, the use of a research assistant to provide the intervention and advice for follow up may not have carried the same weight as a health care professional. Adding the element of motivational interviewing by a mental health provider may have increased the percentage of families who followed up for a mental health evaluation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24015" xml_f="24103" txt_i="17180" txt_f="17268">Recent evidence supports a collaborative approach to mental health treatment in adults [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"><offsets xml_i="24135" xml_f="24137" txt_i="17268" txt_f="17270">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24144" xml_f="24304" txt_i="17270" txt_f="17430">] with an integration of services into the primary care setting resulting in a significant increased engagement into services compared to an enhanced referral [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"><offsets xml_i="24336" xml_f="24338" txt_i="17430" txt_f="17432">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24345" xml_f="24529" txt_i="17432" txt_f="17616">].
