Of those who completed the six-month followup, 64% of participants in the intensive counseling plus self-monitoring smartphone group and 40% in the less intensive counseling plus self-monitoring smartphone group achieved greater than or equal to 5% decrease in their body weight. In contrast, only 25% in the counseling only group and 20% in the self-monitoring smartphone only group achieved at least a 5% weight loss. There were no differences in weight loss based on age; however, females were more likely to lose weight compared to males (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="20707" xml_f="20708" txt_i="15741" txt_f="15742">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="20717" xml_f="20748" txt_i="15742" txt_f="15773"> = 0.005) (Data are not shown.)</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20755" xml_f="21214" txt_i="15774" txt_f="16233">Self-reported physical activity of moderate or greater intensity appeared to decrease in all groups except for a slight increase in the smartphone only group.

Although not powered to detect statistically significant between group differences in changes in weight, the trends supported our a priori hypothesis that participants randomized to the counseling plus self-monitoring smartphone technology would achieve greater weight loss than those in the counseling or smartphone only groups. Mean weight loss at 6 months in the intensive counseling plus self-monitoring smartphone group, − 5.4 kg (4.0), was clinically significant and comparable to weight loss achieved at six months in the POWER Trial. At 6 months in the POWER Trial, the mean (±SE) adjusted change in weight from baseline was − 1.4 ± 0.4 kg in the control group, − 6.1 ± 0.5 kg in the group receiving remote support only, and − 5.8 ± 0.6 kg in the group receiving in-person support [</offsets><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="22260" xml_f="22262" txt_i="17202" txt_f="17204">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22269" xml_f="22497" txt_i="17204" txt_f="17432">].

Participants in the less intensive counseling plus self-monitoring smartphone group lost an average of 2.1 kg less weight as compared to the intensive counseling plus self-monitoring smartphone group.

Use of the self-monitoring smartphone technology, regardless of intensity of counseling, showed to be more effective at decreasing participants' percent intake of calories from fat. At baseline, participants on average consumed slightly above the recommended macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) of 20–35% of calories from fat as recommended by the Institute of Medicine [</offsets><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="23545" xml_f="23547" txt_i="18436" txt_f="18438">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23554" xml_f="24210" txt_i="18438" txt_f="19091">]. After the six-month intervention, the groups utilizing the self-monitoring smartphone technology showed a greater decrease in the percent of calories from fat than the intensive counseling alone, and the percentage of calories from fat also fell within the AMDR and approached meeting the goals of the DASH diet of &lt;25% calories from fat. Contrasting with percent calories from fat, greater reduction of sodium intake was seen with participants who had face-to-face counseling compared to those using the smartphone only, though the greatest reductions in sodium intake were seen in the intensive and less intensive counseling plus smartphone groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24217" xml_f="24980" txt_i="19092" txt_f="19855">These two secondary outcomes suggest a complementary or additive effect of the face-to-face counseling and the smartphone application Lose It! displays the macronutrient distribution of a user's intake prominently on the “My Day” tab, but the user must navigate to another touch screen to obtain information on sodium intake. A trained nutrition counselor or health coach can easily identify foods high in sodium in a participant's diet log and provide education and counseling on reduction strategies during face-to-face visits. However, it may be more difficult for a nutritionist or health coach to estimate the percent calories from fat. This may explain the observed differences between groups for the percent of calories from fat and sodium intake measures.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24987" xml_f="25452" txt_i="19856" txt_f="20321">Fruit and vegetable intake showed little improvement in 3 of the 4 groups, where increase in the number of servings of fruits and vegetables consumed ranged from 0.05 to 0.81 servings. Only the less intensive counseling group plus self-monitoring smartphone technology showed a large increase in the number of fruits and vegetables consumed with an additional 2.1 servings per day, though they had the lowest number of servings of fruits and vegetables at baseline.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25459" xml_f="26120" txt_i="20322" txt_f="20983">This pilot study has several strengths. Although not powered to detect statistically significant differences in weight change between groups, the randomized design equalized groups on important baseline characteristics and allowed investigators to observe trends in effectiveness of the four interventions. In addition, it was designed to examine the effect of decreasing face-to-face counseling sessions supplementing with smartphone technology for self-monitoring which could be a cost-effective and translatable strategy. The self-monitoring smartphone application is a popular commercially available application which has not been comprehensively evaluated.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26127" xml_f="26676" txt_i="20984" txt_f="21533">Study limitations included an overall attrition rate of 37% and the attrition was not equal among the groups. Generalizability of the pilot study results is limited given that the sample was predominately female. However, it is noteworthy that 49% of the participants were African American. Twenty-eight percent of those who completed the trial also reported that at some time during the trial they had used another weight loss intervention (e.g., computer programs or smartphone applications) in addition to their originally allocated intervention.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title><offsets xml_i="26708" xml_f="26722" txt_i="21535" txt_f="21549">5. Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26733" xml_f="27793" txt_i="21550" txt_f="22610">This pilot trial of a weight loss intervention using a smartphone application for self-monitoring as an adjunct to behavioral counseling has provided valuable data to inform a larger randomized controlled trial. Given the attrition rates and unequal dropout, a larger trial will need to implement robust retention strategies. Two control groups (IC and SP only groups) and two levels of intensity of counseling with smartphone self-monitoring groups were used in this pilot. It may be more cost-effective for a full trial to compare counseling plus smartphone self-monitoring, the seemingly most robust intervention, with what is currently offered as standard of care for weight loss in primary care settings. Testing in a larger trial, a state-of-the-art mobile technology application that represents a convenient and increasingly available and acceptable means of reaching a substantial proportion of the population has the potential to provide evidence to support an intervention that could impact substantially the serious public health problem of obesity.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This research was funded through a grant from the Center for Behavior and Health, Johns Hopkins
