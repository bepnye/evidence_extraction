These include GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Altana, Aventis, Celgene, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim and various small biotechnology companies. As consultant to these companies he serves on advisory boards to provide expert input into development of new products, clinical trial design, development of protocols and slide presentations. The honorarium he receives for these consultancies ranges for $600-1,200. He has never received more than $3,000 in any one year from any company. He does not and never has had any stock or other equity ownership in pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. He does not at present and never has had a patent licensing arrangement with any company. He receives grant and research support from several pharmaceutical companies. He directs a phase 2 clinical research unit, dedicated to the evaluation of new drugs for airways disease. As a result, he performs a number of studies, similar to that reported in this manuscript. He does not personally benefit financially from any grant or research support income. He has spoken for AstraZeneca, GSK, Pfizer, Boehringer Ingelheim and Altana for several years. The speakers honorarium never exceeds $1,000. His annual speaker fees never exceeds a total of $10,000. He has provided this statement based on his recollection of activities in partnership with pharmaceutical companies and other commercial associations that might be considered to pose a conflict of interest.
