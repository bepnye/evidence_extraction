Also, continuous irrigation makes monitoring the amount of bleeding not possible. Significant bleeding may occur during the procedure and maintenance of hemodynamic stability may be too difficult. For this reason, choosing an anesthetic agent is very critical, because it must have a minimal effect on hemodynamic parameters. There are a limited number of studies about hemodynamic responses of anesthesia on this procedure. Therefore, the present study investigated the hemodynamic changes and recovery of this procedure and the results were compared with other studies [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="7415" xml_f="7416" txt_i="2953" txt_f="2954">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7423" xml_f="7424" txt_i="2954" txt_f="2955">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="7455" xml_f="7456" txt_i="2955" txt_f="2956">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7463" xml_f="7465" txt_i="2956" txt_f="2958">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7472" xml_f="7869" txt_i="2959" txt_f="3356">Hemodynamic changes may also be caused by inadequate anesthesia levels in patients undergoing operation.
