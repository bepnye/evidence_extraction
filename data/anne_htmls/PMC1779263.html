The within-floor improvements over the study period were ascertained by examination of percentage mean improvement by group compared to baseline scores, and by using two-sided paired t-tests on 22 and 45 d.f. respectively. Finally, two-sided unpaired t-tests were used to examine whether there was a statistically significant difference in individual scores at the end of the intervention period in the two groups, controlling for individual baseline scores. A total of thirty questionnaire items or scores were examined from the two questionnaires, and a Bonferroni correction for Type I errors was accordingly applied to each set of tests based on this total number when interpreting the significance of the t-statistics obtained: the threshold t-statistic used to determine significance was deemed equal to probability divided by 30, the total number of questionnaire items examined.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20880" xml_f="20887" txt_i="16169" txt_f="16176">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20898" xml_f="21191" txt_i="16177" txt_f="16470">Sixty-nine individuals agreed to take part in the study (23 on the control floor and 46 on the intervention floor), representing 49% of the total eligible population during the study period.

However, it is reassuring that there was a statistically significant difference between groups for a key measure at study end, which can reasonably be attributed to the effects of the intervention, beyond any seasonal effects.
