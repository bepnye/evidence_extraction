A sample of 150 patients with subacute and chronic LBP who attend a private physical therapy clinic for treatment will be recruited. At baseline, all participants will undergo a standard evaluation by trained research physical therapists and will be classified into one of the following subgroups: direction-specific exercises, manipulation, or stabilisation. The patient will not be informed about the results of the examination. Patients will be randomly assigned to classification-based treatment or usual care according to the Dutch LBP guidelines, and will complete questionnaires at baseline, and 8, 26, and 52 weeks after the start of the treatment. The primary outcomes will be general perceived recovery, functional status, and pain intensity.

The examination starts with the determination of a directional preference, based on the definition proposed in the MDT classification method (step 1 in Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"><offsets xml_i="18831" xml_f="18832" txt_i="12890" txt_f="12891">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18839" xml_f="18842" txt_i="12891" txt_f="12894">) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"><offsets xml_i="18874" xml_f="18876" txt_i="12894" txt_f="12896">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18883" xml_f="20047" txt_i="12896" txt_f="14060">]. This involves the monitoring of symptomatic and mechanical responses during repetitive end-range lumbar test movements (flexion, extension, side-gliding, or rotation) and/or prolonged positioning. A directional preference is established if certain postures or repeated end-range movements in one direction (e.g. flexion) cause the symptoms to improve or centralise (pain moves from a distal to a proximal area), and in the opposite direction (e.g. extension) cause the symptoms to worsen or peripheralise (pain moves from a proximal to a distal area). Priority is given to peripheral pain locations and their response, regardless of the response of the central pain intensity. The improved or centralised symptoms must be retained in a neutral standing position. A directional preference is not established if the symptoms and the pain immediately reappear. For the sake of clarity, patients with a directional preference do not necessarily have centralisation of the symptoms. After this assessment, several other physical tests, such as the prone instability test, thigh thrust test, and the active straight leg raise test will be performed (step 2 in Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"><offsets xml_i="20077" xml_f="20078" txt_i="14060" txt_f="14061">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20085" xml_f="20179" txt_i="14061" txt_f="14155">).

The classification decision-making has a hierarchical structure, however, all patients will undergo the entire examination procedure. In cases of uncertainty about the primary classification, extra criteria, such as three or more prior LBP episodes in the medical history and a visible lateral shift during the examination, will be used to determine the patient's subgroup (step 3 in Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2"><offsets xml_i="20660" xml_f="20661" txt_i="14550" txt_f="14551">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20668" xml_f="21490" txt_i="14551" txt_f="15373">).

The patient will not be informed about the results of the examination. Reasons for exclusion, such as inability to demonstrate any LBP symptoms during the examination, will be registered.
