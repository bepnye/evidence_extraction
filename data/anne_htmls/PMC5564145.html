Lipid solubility determines the degree of penetration of the molecules into nerve membranes. Therefore, articaine diffuses better through soft tissues than do other anesthetics, thereby achieving higher intra-neural concentrations, more extensive longitudinal spreading, and a better blockade of conduction. A second molecular difference between articaine and other amide local anesthetics is the extra ester linkage incorporated into the articaine molecule, which results in hydrolysis of articaine by plasma esterase.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17981" xml_f="18087" txt_i="11652" txt_f="11758">Local infiltrate technique with 4% articaine was an effective method of anesthetizing a mandibular tooth [</offsets><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18119" xml_f="18121" txt_i="11758" txt_f="11760">10</offsets></xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18160" xml_f="18162" txt_i="11760" txt_f="11762">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18169" xml_f="18379" txt_i="11762" txt_f="11972">].
