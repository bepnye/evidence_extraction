The MBSR program was delivered by an experienced MBSR instructor. Patients attended an initial one-to-one orientation interview with the instructor. The program included psycho education about stress and meditation techniques such as the body scan, mindful yoga and sitting meditation. Subjects met for eight consecutive weeks for two hours in a group format. Sessions typically consisted of a didactic portion, in-class teacher-led exercises, and discussions on everyday applications of mindfulness skills, mindful eating and walking. Each session focused on specific formal and informal mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques. Cognitive exercises such as observing the association between worried thoughts, mood and behavior were introduced by the leader and subjects had the opportunity to practice the techniques in the form of homework assignments. Subjects were asked to practice the formal meditation practices at least 30 min every day and to record their practice. At the end of the eight-week course, subjects completed self-report measures.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11446" xml_f="11454" txt_i="6554" txt_f="6562">Measures</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11474" xml_f="11508" txt_i="6563" txt_f="6597">Beck depression inventory (BDI-II)</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11519" xml_f="11565" txt_i="6598" txt_f="6644">The Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijph-41-24"><offsets xml_i="11608" xml_f="11610" txt_i="6644" txt_f="6646">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11617" xml_f="11809" txt_i="6646" txt_f="6838">) is a 21-item questionnaire that is routinely used to assess affective, cognitive, motivational, behavioral, and biological symptoms of depression and has acceptable psychometric properties (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijph-41-24"><offsets xml_i="11852" xml_f="11854" txt_i="6838" txt_f="6840">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11861" xml_f="11862" txt_i="6840" txt_f="6841">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijph-41-24"><offsets xml_i="11905" xml_f="11907" txt_i="6841" txt_f="6843">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11914" xml_f="11916" txt_i="6843" txt_f="6845">).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11938" xml_f="11966" txt_i="6847" txt_f="6875">Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11977" xml_f="11986" txt_i="6876" txt_f="6885">The BAI (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijph-41-24"><offsets xml_i="12029" xml_f="12031" txt_i="6885" txt_f="6887">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12038" xml_f="12483" txt_i="6887" txt_f="7332">) is a 21-item scale that reliably discriminates anxiety from depression while displaying convergent validity.

Most participants experienced reductions in depression, anxiety, and worry as a result of participating in the MBSR course. We found that MBSR produced clinically meaningful changes on measures of anxiety, mood, and worry.
