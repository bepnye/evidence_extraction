These potential advantages of the SF-6D over alternative instruments should be substantiated in additional studies. A further point of interest may be the difference in methodology applied in deriving a utility score, which could imply that utilities with different "meaning" are obtained, thus resulting in confusion when interpreting results from studies using different instruments [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="6429" xml_f="6431" txt_i="3203" txt_f="3205">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6438" xml_f="6922" txt_i="3205" txt_f="3689">]. Potentially, policy decisions could be compromised by using utilities that are not equivalent. Therefore, we sought to assess the equivalency of the SF-6D and the EQ-5D cross-sectionally, in domain content, in scoring distribution, and in the amount of change measured after intervention. We addressed these questions by comparing the SF-6D and EQ-5D qualitatively and quantitatively, using data from two randomised controlled trials of patients with symptomatic coronary stenosis.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="6963" xml_f="6970" txt_i="3691" txt_f="3698">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6981" xml_f="7366" txt_i="3699" txt_f="4084">We included patients with symptomatic coronary stenosis enrolled in two multicenter randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy of the Octopus tissue stabiliser for bypass grafting.

We found clear differences between these utility measures: conceptual, in baseline scores and in sensitivity to change. First of all, the number of domains differs: 5 versus 6. However, the contribution of the SF-6D vitality domain, which has no counterpart in the EQ-5D, is small. Therefore, one could expect that domains tapping similar areas of health have somewhat equal contributions to the total score. This is the case for the domains pain and mood/mental health. However, the content and weights of the other domains show considerable differences, with the EQ-5D giving more weight to physical functioning and the SF-6D to social functioning. A second difference is that the recall period of both instruments is different: today for EQ-5D, versus the last four weeks (or one week in the acute version of the SF-36) for the SF-6D. The third difference is that the scoring range of the EQ-5D is twice that of the SF-6D. The location of the baseline median scores in the scoring range was quite different: in the top quarter for EQ-5D, halfway for the SF-6D. A fourth difference was that the distributions were significantly different from each other, although the mean values appeared to be similar. The difference between the median values and the limits of agreement in the Bland-Altman plot exceed the minimal clinically important difference of both SF-6D and EQ-5D [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="26760" xml_f="26762" txt_i="16667" txt_f="16669">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26769" xml_f="26770" txt_i="16669" txt_f="16670">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="26802" xml_f="26804" txt_i="16670" txt_f="16672">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26811" xml_f="26874" txt_i="16672" txt_f="16735">].

Both measures recorded change in the PTCA group, but differed in the CABG groups: EQ-5D scores improved significantly, but SF-6D scores did not change. The SF-6D recorded greater change than the EQ-5D in the PTCA group, despite its narrower scoring range. In the CABG groups, the change in the EQ-5D was caused by change in anxiety/depression and mobility. There was however no corresponding improvement in the SF-6D physical functioning domain. The significant deterioration in social functioning and role limitations cancelled out the improvement in mental health, resulting in no change in the overall SF-6D score. Another important reason for the difference in amount of change after CABG may lie in the differing recall periods: with a post-intervention assessment at one month, the 4-week recall period of the SF-36 encompasses both the intervention and recovery period, as compared to today's health status in the EQ-5D. However, the difference between SF-6D and EQ-5D remains at the subsequent measurements. This cannot be fully explained by different recall periods, as patients are stable by 6 months, and today's health should not differ that much from that over the last 4 weeks.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28137" xml_f="28375" txt_i="17986" txt_f="18224">Both measures display non-normal distributions, both at baseline and in change over time.

We used that technique to reduce the number of missing scores in the SF-6D; imputing a value for missing items in a SF-36 domain using the mean value for that domain. This way, the amount of missing scores in the SF-6D due to incomplete questionnaires was halved, from about 12% to 6% of the total number of SF-6D scores. Imputation did not affect the median values. Note however that this solution would not be viable if the SF-6D would be administered without the other SF-36 questions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30681" xml_f="30770" txt_i="20210" txt_f="20299">Recently, some studies were done that compared the EQ-5D and the SF-6D, as in our study [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="30802" xml_f="30804" txt_i="20299" txt_f="20301">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30811" xml_f="30812" txt_i="20301" txt_f="20302">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"><offsets xml_i="30844" xml_f="30846" txt_i="20302" txt_f="20304">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30853" xml_f="30854" txt_i="20304" txt_f="20305">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"><offsets xml_i="30886" xml_f="30888" txt_i="20305" txt_f="20307">29</offsets></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"><offsets xml_i="30927" xml_f="30929" txt_i="20307" txt_f="20309">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30936" xml_f="31033" txt_i="20309" txt_f="20406">], but baseline values clearly differ in more severe patients such as liver transplant patients [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"><offsets xml_i="31065" xml_f="31067" txt_i="20406" txt_f="20408">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31074" xml_f="31111" txt_i="20408" txt_f="20445">] and patients with a recent stroke [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="31143" xml_f="31145" txt_i="20445" txt_f="20447">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31152" xml_f="31274" txt_i="20447" txt_f="20569">].

Although the mean utility scores appear to be similar, the differences in median values, scoring range and sensitivity to change after intervention and the low agreement show that the EQ-5D and SF-6D yield incomparable scores. Even within a group of patients with the same diagnosis, the EQ-5D and SF-6D yield different scores, while sensitivity to change seems to be influenced by the type of intervention. The SF-6D has better distributional properties than the EQ-5D, but that did not result in improved sensitivity to change. However, it cannot be said which instrument is correct. Clearly, the SF-6D measures something else than the EQ-5D, and these instruments cannot be used interchangeably.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33562" xml_f="33819" txt_i="22575" txt_f="22832">Currently, there is no clear benefit in using the SF-6D in clinical studies instead of the EQ-5D, as the SF-6D is not clearly better.
