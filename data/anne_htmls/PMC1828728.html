This reflects the differences in the health care systems between the USA and the UK, where there is free access to health care. In our study, over two thirds of our parents responded that giving something in return for their care had influenced their decision to participate.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20167" xml_f="20343" txt_i="15604" txt_f="15780">One of the limitations of the present study, and the questionnaire method, is the response rate (59% in our current study).

Of those who did not respond we do not know if their views would be similar to those who were willing to fill in the questionnaire. This may mean that we overestimate the positive attitudes to this and future studies. There would also have been a recall bias associated with mailing the questionnaire to all parents at the end of the study. Some parents may have been recruited to the trial up to two years prior to the questionnaire being completed and therefore their recall would have been different to those recruited in the last few months. There was however an equal spread of responses over the recruitment period and the time since recruitment did not statistically alter the responses to the questions of information, time and remembering consent. Our results are based on the responses to a single study, in a general paediatric condition, and thus the results may not be generalizable to other studies that have different risk/benefit profiles.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21362" xml_f="21372" txt_i="16741" txt_f="16751">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21383" xml_f="22198" txt_i="16752" txt_f="17567">This study has highlighted that the reasons that parents consent for clinical trials in the United Kingdom is similar to that seen in other European countries. Future work, ideally within a multinational trial of the same disease profile, to compare parental attitudes within different health care systems would be interesting. The majority of parents consent because they see the clinical need of the trials to answer questions for the treatment of future children. When financial incentives and cost of health care are introduced this may change motives. It is important that we understand the motivation of parents, within our own populations and different disease profiles, with the introduction of European legislation to ensure that all medicines are studied in children and the challenges that it will bring.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22220" xml_f="22239" txt_i="17569" txt_f="17588">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22250" xml_f="22310" txt_i="17589" txt_f="17649">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22332" xml_f="22354" txt_i="17651" txt_f="17673">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22365" xml_f="22863" txt_i="17674" txt_f="18172">HMS conceived the questionnaire study and designed, distributed, analysed the questionnaire and drafted the manuscript.
