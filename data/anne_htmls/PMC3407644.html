The study period was 18 weeks (6 weeks for the intervention and 12 weeks for followup). The results show that there were no differences between the two groups for the scores of eight factors on the SF-36 (Chinese version of the SF-36 universal quality-of-life scale) at baseline. Compared with the baseline score, intervention with XPYS-HEG led to a significant increase in scores for the factor of bodily pain at the end of the 6th week. Compared with the score at the end of the 6th week, the score for the factor of mental health in the XPYS group significantly increased at the end of the 18th week. Therefore, XPYS-HEG could partially improve the quality of life for people with FPSH and liver-qi stagnation and spleen-qi deficiency syndrome, which can ease bodily pain, stimulate a positive mood, and ease a negative mood.</offsets></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title><offsets xml_i="7125" xml_f="7140" txt_i="1190" txt_f="1205">1.

Block sizes of 2 and 4 were used to balance the assignments across groups and to prevent decoding of the system. Assignments were stratified within the centers. The allocations were placed in numbered opaque envelopes to be opened by the doctors in the presence of the participants. The process of disclosed blinding included two steps. The first disclosure was performed after completion of the reviewing of the data, that is, only disclosing the code A or B of each case to the statistician. The second was performed after completing the statistical analysis and report, that is, disclosing the corresponding group of A and B. The removal of the blinding during the process of this trial was executed by the researchers when serious adverse event occurred or the participant needed emergency medical treatment.

According to the theory of TCM, the effect of XPYS-HEG on the quality of life in participants is explained as follows. (1) The spleen governs the muscles, flesh and the four limbs. Replenishing the spleen qi and nourishing the blood can nourish the four limbs. The liver governs the sinews, and when the liver obtains blood, the sinews stretch, which may explain why XPYS-HEG could ease both bodily pain and influence the work and housework resulting from bodily pain among people with FPSH and liver-qi stagnation and spleen-qi deficiency syndrome. (2) Dispersing and discharging functions of the liver can regulate emotion.
