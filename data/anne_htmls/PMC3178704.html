One-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction was applied to evaluate the main effects and interactions on all of the dependent variables in each of the three groups by time (prior to and after the 12-week program). Differences in the inter-group analysis were tested with the ANCOVA and the post-hoc analysis was performed by using the Tukey method for multiple comparison tests.

However, this relative weight loss also resulted in reduced muscle mass in the AE group when compared to that of the DO group.

Therefore, identifying interventions that can improve insulin sensitivity are critical for defining effective approaches for preventing metabolic diseases associated with obesity, especially in at-risk individuals, such as overweight adolescents. In this study, insulin sensitivity improved in both of the exercise groups (AE and RT) when compared to their baseline values, as reflected by adecreased insulin AUC values and an increased insulin sensitivity index. This improvement in the RT group is consistent with the results published by Bell et al.

However, inter-group analysis did not show significant differences when compared to the other groups, but we presume that this is due to the small number of participants in each of the three groups.

Thus, our results of how a given exercise influences OGTT insulin values provide only an estimate of how insulin acts.

Maturation and/or age should be considered during stratification and during analysis in order to minimize potential confounding variables since they may influence metabolic factors in growing children and adolescents. Therefore, we adjusted for age, sex, and baseline BMI in our statistical analysis. Aerobic components (warm up and cool down periods) in the resistance training protocol and dietary manipulations in both of the exercising group may have led to some changes that make it more difficult to distinguish the independent effects of each group. Furthermore, data on dietary outcomes such as total energy intake and dietary fat were not available for use in the analysis. To further validate our results, we recommend additional studies that include a larger sample size, longer program duration and consideration of the maturation level and age of the study subjects. The strength of this study includes the involvement of a trained exercise physiologist and the enrollment of enthusiastic students that had succeeded in a remarkable 100% attendance rate.
