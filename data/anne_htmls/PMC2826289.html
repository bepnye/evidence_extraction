The majority of subjects were female (81.8%) and all were Caucasian. Subjects included in the study were between 36 and 82 years of age. The average age was 62.5 years. Although subjects over the age of 80 were excluded from the study because many subjects past this age have multiple health issues that might impact their participation or end results, 2 patients over the age of 80 were included because they met all other study criteria and were in good overall health. The subjects' standard of care for RA was not altered during the course of the study. Most subjects were taking and continued to take disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (17 in the placebo group and 18 in the study treatment group) and 5 subjects continued to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (3 in the placebo group and 2 in the study treatment group). Four subjects were not taking medication for RA (3 in the placebo group and 1 in the treatment group). One subject developed an upper respiratory infection (URI) and was started on antibiotics, so the study treatment was discontinued. This subject did not return for further visits and was, therefore, excluded from analyses. Although this was not an intent-to-treat analysis due to the 1 subject who discontinued treatment, each study group included 22 patients for analysis.</offsets></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="16440" xml_f="16448" txt_i="11794" txt_f="11802">Figure 1</offsets></label><caption><p><bold><offsets xml_i="16474" xml_f="16489" txt_i="11802" txt_f="11817">Study flowchart</offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="16496" xml_f="16497" txt_i="11817" txt_f="11818">.</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6882-10-1-1"></graphic></fig><sec><title><offsets xml_i="16578" xml_f="16586" txt_i="11819" txt_f="11827">Efficacy</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16597" xml_f="16619" txt_i="11828" txt_f="11850">Subjects who received </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16627" xml_f="16646" txt_i="11850" txt_f="11869">Bacillus coagulans </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16655" xml_f="16781" txt_i="11869" txt_f="11995">GBI-30, 6086 experienced borderline statistically significant improvement from baseline in the Patient Pain Assessment score (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16789" xml_f="16791" txt_i="11995" txt_f="11997">P </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16800" xml_f="16883" txt_i="11997" txt_f="12080">= .052) and statistically significant improvement from baseline in the Pain Scale (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16891" xml_f="16893" txt_i="12080" txt_f="12082">P </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16902" xml_f="16964" txt_i="12082" txt_f="12144">= .046) compared with subjects randomized to receive placebo. </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16972" xml_f="16991" txt_i="12144" txt_f="12163">Bacillus coagulans </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="17000" xml_f="17153" txt_i="12163" txt_f="12316">GBI-30, 6086 treatment resulted in greater improvement in patient global assessment, patient self-assessed disability, and reduction in total CRP (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="17185" xml_f="17186" txt_i="12316" txt_f="12317">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17193" xml_f="17422" txt_i="12317" txt_f="12546">).
