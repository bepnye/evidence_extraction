To date, no studies have assessed the effect of consuming a typical breakfast prior to exercise on post-exercise cognitive performance, mood, appetite and energy intake (EI) in recreationally active females; the current paper describes two studies which aimed to explore this paradigm. To begin, a pilot field study was conducted to investigate whether consuming breakfast prior to morning exercise affects cognitive performance, mood, appetite and energy intake (EI) for the remainder of the day. The results from this study suggested that breakfast size may influence post-exercise mood and appetite. Subsequently, a randomized controlled trial was conducted to see if a small breakfast, which was quick to consume and digest and therefore perhaps be suited to this population, could lead to cognitive or mood benefits over no breakfast or consuming a larger breakfast prior to a morning exercise session; this study will provide the main focus of the paper.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="10355" xml_f="10378" txt_i="5251" txt_f="5274">2.

An increase in EI at breakfast was associated with lower mental fatigue, higher alertness and EI and better overall mood post-exercise. The limitations of conducting a field study are obvious; a lack of control over the environment in which the study is completed which may lead to confounding results and the inability to detect subtle effects which may only become apparent in a more controlled environment.
