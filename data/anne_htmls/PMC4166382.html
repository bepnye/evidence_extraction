Given this characteristic of palonosetron, we investigated the effects of continuous infusion in the context of a PCA on the incidence of PONV in high-risk patients. We observed that the incidence of PONV decreased with supplemental continuous infusion of palonosetron following a single injection of palonosetron, and we assumed that similar to the case of ramosetron, continuous infusion of palonosetron using a PCA increased the plasma concentration of palonosetron, thereby improving receptor occupancy and antiemetic action.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15123" xml_f="15415" txt_i="9987" txt_f="10279">Compared with the 0-2 h (18.2 vs. 31.8%, P = 0.108) and 2-6 h (15.2 vs. 12.1%, P = 0.800) time intervals, the difference in PONV incidence between the continuous infusion group and the single injection group was marginally significant at the 6-24 h time interval (13.6 vs. 27.3%, P = 0.084) (</offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="15445" xml_f="15451" txt_i="10279" txt_f="10285">Fig. 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15458" xml_f="16378" txt_i="10285" txt_f="11205">). This result suggests that additional continuous infusion could potentially prevent PONV during the late postoperative period (6-24 h). A similar difference was observed at the 0-2 h time interval, although this difference was also not statistically significant. It is interesting that the amount of additionally administered palonosetron during the period was quite small. However, little is known about the relationship between the pharmacokinetic profile of palonosetron and its clinical effects. Furthermore, the etiology of PONV is complex and multi-factorial, and additional factors such as patient transportation and volume status during the 0-2 h time interval, as well as diet and ambulation during the late postoperative period, may contribute to the incidence of PONV. Although the amount of palonosetron added to the PCA device was small, it appeared to be helpful in controlling PONV during these periods.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16385" xml_f="17043" txt_i="11206" txt_f="11864">In this study, continuous infusion of palonosetron in addition to single injection resulted in a similar incidence of side-effects compared to single injection only, indicating a similar safety profile. Two vials of palonosetron (0.075 mg each) were used in the continuous infusion group; further studies are warranted to determine the optimum rate of continuous palonosetron infusion and to evaluate its cost effectiveness in high-risk patients and clinical situations in which PONV is extremely harmful.
