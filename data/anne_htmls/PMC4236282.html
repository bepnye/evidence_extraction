The attention-control intervention, focused solely on nutrition psychoeducation, resulted in more extensive benefits than did MI, when compared to UC. These findings, however, are preliminary and require further examination with longer intervention and follow-up assessments, to the extent that is feasible within PC settings. Longer interventions, with focus on more specific nutritional information related to improving weight-related conditions (e.g., low-sugar to decrease HbA1c) may have more extensive metabolic benefits. Conceivably, MI may best be utilized within PC to encourage enrollment into in-house or external weight loss programs. Additional areas of future research include developing more extensive, and most importantly, free or low cost and accessible web-based weight loss resources available to PC settings that can serve as an adjunct to PC clinician support. Continuing to examine these and other elements of addressing weight loss in PC may further improve outcomes.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><p>This study was supported by NIH career development awards, K23-DK092279 for RDB and K24-DK070052 for CMG.</p><p>We thank Drs.
