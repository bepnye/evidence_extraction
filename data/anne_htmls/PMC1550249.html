Despite good clinical results with ICSI, the procedure is typically associated with degeneration of a significant percentage (approximately 10%) of the treated oocytes. The cause of this degeneration remains unclear. Speculation that damage caused by oocyte compression during the injection procedure may be responsible has led to the development of a novel technique known as laser-assisted ICSI. This procedure involves drilling a small hole through the zona pellucida with a laser prior to sperm injection. Preliminary studies have suggested that laser-assisted ICSI may dramatically reduce oocyte degeneration rates. The objective of this study was to examine whether the reported benefits of laser-assisted ICSI could be verified on a larger, less-selected group of patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="4548" xml_f="4555" txt_i="970" txt_f="977">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4566" xml_f="5057" txt_i="978" txt_f="1469">Oocytes retrieved from 59 patients scheduled for ICSI were randomly divided into equal treatment and control groups.

Thus, zona damage does not appear to be the cause of ICSI induced oocyte degeneration. The mechanical compression and distortion of the oocyte that commonly occurs, to varying degrees, during injection is another potential source of damage leading to oocyte degeneration.

Other diagnoses included endometriosis (n = 4), tubal factor (n = 3), PCO (n = 3), diminished ovarian reserve (n = 2), ovulation disorder (n = 2), and unexplained infertility (n = 7). The remaining four couples were diagnosed with a combination of both male and female factor infertility. The overall mean fertilization rate was 71.1%, with a mean oocyte degeneration rate of 12.0%. Mean embryo cell number was 3.0 on day 2 and 5.6 on day 3. Mean degree of embryo fragmentation was 7.6% on day 2 and 9.8% on day 3. Embryos were transferred to 44 patients at the cleavage stage on day 3 (mean = 2.5 embryos per transfer), and to 14 patients at the blastocyst stage on day 5 or 6 (mean = 1.9 embryos per transfer). In only one cycle was no transfer performed due to poor embryo quality. There were 26 pregnancies (44.8% per transfer) with 34 implantations (24.5% per embryo), based on ultrasound detection of fetal cardiac activity five to six weeks after embryo transfer, resulting in 20 live births and 3 spontaneous abortions, with three pregnancies ongoing at last report.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18439" xml_f="18524" txt_i="13343" txt_f="13428">Clinical outcomes are compared between laser-assisted and conventional ICSI in Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="18556" xml_f="18557" txt_i="13428" txt_f="13429">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18564" xml_f="19118" txt_i="13429" txt_f="13983">. No significant differences were observed for any of the measured outcome variables. The difference in blastocyst formation rates among the 14 cycles with blastocyst stage embryo transfer was nearly statistically significant at an alpha of 0.05. However, given that this probability estimate does not include an adjustment for multiple comparisons (thus increasing the potential for type I error), and none of the many other comparisons that were

Thus, calculations of compaction and blastocyst formation rates for embryos not transferred on day 3 (as reported in the tables) include proportionally fewer of the higher quality embryos in the normal zona group compared to the difficult zona group.

All embryologists performing ICSI in this study were highly skilled and had years of experience performing ICSI and working successfully with the laser for embryo manipulation procedures such as assisted hatching and embryo biopsy. Embryologists performing the procedure felt that it was relatively simple and could be performed quickly, although even with practice the entire process of insemination was still more time consuming with the addition of the laser micromanipulation. They also agreed that the compression of the oocytes during the ICSI procedure was dramatically reduced in the laser-assisted group, as previously reported [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="36257" xml_f="36259" txt_i="26240" txt_f="26242">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36266" xml_f="36268" txt_i="26242" txt_f="26244">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36275" xml_f="36946" txt_i="26245" txt_f="26916">We question the rationale for hypothesizing reduced oocyte degeneration with laser-assisted ICSI versus conventional ICSI. While laser-assisted ICSI does dramatically reduce oocyte compression, we are aware of no evidence suggesting increased oocyte degeneration in association with oocyte compression resulting from either zonae pellucidae or oolemmas that are difficult to penetrate, and our results do not suggest such a relationship. The one feature that has been clearly associated with oocyte degeneration rates, a fragile oolemma, seems unlikely to be responsive to laser pre-drilling of the zona pellucida because the oolemma is not manipulated by this procedure.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36953" xml_f="37543" txt_i="26917" txt_f="27507">Although we found no clinical benefit to drilling through the zona with a laser before sperm injection, we also found no evidence of harm as a result of the laser micromanipulation of oocytes. Oocytes inseminated by laser-assisted ICSI were as likely to be fertilized successfully as, and had similar preimplantation developmental potential to, oocytes inseminated by conventional ICSI. This study therefore provides evidence for the safety of laser micromanipulation of human oocytes via the comparable preimplantation development of embryos derived from both the study and control groups.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37565" xml_f="37575" txt_i="27509" txt_f="27519">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37586" xml_f="38305" txt_i="27520" txt_f="28239">In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that there is no benefit of laser pre-drilling of the zona pellucida over conventional ICSI with regard to fertilization and embryo development. Moreover, examination of results according to the breakage patterns of the zona or the oolemma did not reveal any subgroups of patients that appeared to benefit from laser-assisted ICSI. Given the increased time required to add laser pre-drilling to the ICSI procedure, there appears to be no justification for its use. However, the potential for benefits within particular patient subgroups deserves further study. There was also no evidence that the laser caused damage that reduced preimplantation developmental potential.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38327" xml_f="38346" txt_i="28241" txt_f="28260">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38357" xml_f="38417" txt_i="28261" txt_f="28321">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38439" xml_f="38461" txt_i="28323" txt_f="28345">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38472" xml_f="38735" txt_i="28346" txt_f="28609">AD and MT conceived the study.
