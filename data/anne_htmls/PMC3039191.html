This is owed to the test condition: which consists of photopic conditions and requirements of the ability for high spatial frequency and fine visual discrimination.

Though the sensitivity of the rod cells are decreased due to the blocking short wavelength light, some population of rods can activate this pathway and transmit signals to the magnocellular pathway. Second, the testing condition of FDT perimetry is not a scotopic condition. In FDT perimetry, ambient room illumination was dim, and background luminance of the monitor was 45 cd/m</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="15646" xml_f="15647" txt_i="10988" txt_f="10989">2</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="15653" xml_f="15903" txt_i="10989" txt_f="11239">. Therefore, it is a mesopic condition. In scotopic conditions, only rod cells are active photoreceptors. Cone cells are also active photoreceptors in mesopic conditions. This means that cone cells are able to mediate visual signals in FDT perimetry.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15910" xml_f="16337" txt_i="11240" txt_f="11667">This study has several limitations that included the absence of preoperative FDT perimetry data, the small number of cases, and the absence of concurrent standard automated perimetry. A larger number of cases, more than 100 cases in each group, could make a difference in the findings between each group, or confirm the result seen in this study. Therefore, further studies are needed to make up for these points in the future.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16344" xml_f="16590" txt_i="11668" txt_f="11914">In conclusion, there were no significant changes in the result of FDT perimetry after cataract surgery between clear and yellow IOLs. When interpreting the results of FDT perimetry, the color and type of IOLs do not need to be taken into account.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>No potential
