Ninety-two patients were assigned to group A (first KBG-treatment period, then control period; each lasting 4 weeks, with about one-year interval) or group B (first control, then KBG-treatment). In forty-nine (27, group A; 22, group B) patients completing all tests, the mean value of the natural logarithmic-scaled reactive hyperemia index (L_RHI) increased and those of serum nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), malondialdehyde, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 decreased significantly during the KBG-treatment period, but not during the control period, and 4-week changes of L_RHI, NEFA, and malondialdehyde between the 2 periods showed significance.

Briefly, a blood pressure cuff was placed on one upper arm, while the contralateral arm served as control. PAT probes were placed on one finger (finger II or III) of each hand (same finger on both hands). After a 5-minute equilibration period, the cuff was inflated to the higher of either 60 mmHg above systolic pressure or 200 mmHg for 5 min and then deflated to induce reactive hyperemia. PAT signals were recorded electronically in both fingers. During these procedures, the subject was requested to remain quiet and still, and the room temperature was controlled at 21–24°C. The RH-PAT data were analyzed by computer with Endo-PAT2000 software version 3.1.2 in an operator-independent manner. The PH-PAT index reflects the extent of reactive hyperemia and was calculated as the ratio of the average amplitude of PAT signal over 1 min starting 1.5 min after cuff deflation (hyperemic finger, A; control finger, C) divided by the average amplitude of the PAT signal of a 2.5-minute duration before cuff inflation (baseline, hyperemic finger, B; control finger, D). Then, the reactive hyperthermia index (RHI) was obtained from this equation: RHI = (A/B)/(C/D) × baseline correction factor.
