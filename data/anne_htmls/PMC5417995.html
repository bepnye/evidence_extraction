However, current treatment paradigms lack objective, high level evidence of long-term efficacy. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effect of autologous fat grafting in patients with cutaneous scars.</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="3994" xml_f="4002" txt_i="415" txt_f="423">METHODS:</offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="4009" xml_f="4193" txt_i="423" txt_f="607"> 17 patients with cutaneous scars affecting quality of life were enrolled and underwent Coleman-type fat grafting. Grafting was completed with either autologous fat or saline at 1mL/cm</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="4198" xml_f="4199" txt_i="607" txt_f="608">2</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="4205" xml_f="4512" txt_i="608" txt_f="915">, and outcomes measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Grafted scars were evaluated using the following criteria(instrument): subjective scar quality assessment (POSAS), hardness (durometer), elasticity (cutometer), color/pigment (colorimeter) and histological analysis. Statistics were completed using SPSS.</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="4525" xml_f="4533" txt_i="916" txt_f="924">RESULTS:</offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="4540" xml_f="5036" txt_i="924" txt_f="1420"> Patients were 42% female, with an mean age of 42.1 ± 12.9 years. POSAS score totals, cutometer and durometer analyses were not significantly different between grafted (fat) and control (saline) scar apperance, elasticity or hardness at 0, 6, or 12 months, respectively. A single significant colorimetric difference in the a* coordinate at 6 months (p = 0.037) was demonstrated, but was not durable at 12 months (p = 0.49). Individual POSAS parameter statistics and histology results are pending.</offsets></p><p><bold><offsets xml_i="5049" xml_f="5060" txt_i="1421" txt_f="1432">CONCLUSION:</offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="5067" xml_f="5442" txt_i="1432" txt_f="1807"> Recently, fat grafting has been increasingly touted for its ability to improve skin/scar quality and appearance. However, our study results demonstrate that this may not be supported by objective or subjective evidence obtained under randomized, placebo-treated conditions. Any putative improvements in scar quality from fat grafting are also achieved using saline controls.</offsets></p></body></article>
