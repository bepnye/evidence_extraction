In our pilot testing of this protocol (n = 10), we included a stimulation site involving lumbar paraspinal musculature. However, subjects were unable to distinguish between A-delta fiber and C-fiber mediated pain perception, in comparison to testing in the extremities. We attributed this difference to the relatively short distance the thermal stimuli had to travel to the dorsal horn from the lumbar musculature. This short distance did not allow subjects to differentiate input based on fiber type.

The interval between stimuli was at least 60 seconds to avoid carryover effects for the preceding thermal stimulus.

However, there are also several limitations to consider when interpreting this study. First, although use of asymptomatic subjects offers advantages, these findings cannot be directly generalized to patients with LBP. In patients with LBP a wider range of psychological scores would be expected, potentially making them more robustly related to hypoalgesia from SMT.

Third, future studies should include control groups and techniques that block peripheral nociceptive input at the level of the dorsal horn. Inclusion of such methodology will allow future researchers to confirm or refute our mechanistic interpretation of these findings.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37142" xml_f="37155" txt_i="28432" txt_f="28445">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37166" xml_f="37199" txt_i="28446" txt_f="28479">SMT – Spinal manipulative therapy</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37206" xml_f="37225" txt_i="28480" txt_f="28499">LBP – Low back pain</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37247" xml_f="37266" txt_i="28501" txt_f="28520">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37277" xml_f="37337" txt_i="28521" txt_f="28581">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37359" xml_f="37381" txt_i="28583" txt_f="28605">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37392" xml_f="37467" txt_i="28606" txt_f="28681">All authors read, edited, and approved the final version of the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37474" xml_f="37633" txt_i="28682" txt_f="28841">SZG was responsible for the initial conception of the research question, securing funding, supervising the protocol, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37640" xml_f="37765" txt_i="28842" txt_f="28967">MDB and MER were responsible for modifying the research question and critically reviewing earlier versions of the manuscript.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37772" xml_f="37891" txt_i="28968" txt_f="29087">GZ and JEB were responsible for administering the protocol and critically reviewing earlier versions of the manuscript.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37913" xml_f="37936" txt_i="29089" txt_f="29112">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37947" xml_f="38011" txt_i="29113" txt_f="29177">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/7/68/prepub"></ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>SZG received start-up support from the College of Public Health and Health Professions at the University of Florida.</p><p>JEB received support from the National Institutes of Health T-32 Neural Plasticity Research Training Fellowship (T32HD043730).</p><p>Kelli Eisenbrown assisted with data collection and data entry.</p><p>Megan Hurlburt and Julia Villa assisted with data collection.</p><p>Gabrielle Shumrak assisted with data entry.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Koes</surname><given-names>BW</given-names></name><name><surname>Assendelft</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name><name><surname>van der Heijden</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Bouter</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Spinal manipulation for low back pain.
