Except for the first session when two facilitators were present, each intervention session was conducted by one facilitator. Monthly meetings with facilitators and researchers were scheduled to evaluate and discuss the progress of the trial, the intervention and associated matters. Participants were informed to notify the facilitators or researchers if they were unable to attend a session. After the session, facilitators contacted those participants who were absent and briefly discussed the topics of that session. However, those participants who were absent in all of the first three sessions were excluded from further participation in the intervention due to an unbridgeable deficiency in knowledge.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22944" xml_f="22952" txt_i="15853" txt_f="15861">Measures</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22972" xml_f="22989" txt_i="15862" txt_f="15879">Effect evaluation</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23009" xml_f="23034" txt_i="15880" txt_f="15905">Primary outcome variables</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23045" xml_f="23178" txt_i="15906" txt_f="16039">The primary outcomes of the effect evaluation are fear of falling, avoidance of activity due to fear of falling, and daily activity. </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="23186" xml_f="23202" txt_i="16039" txt_f="16055">Fear of falling </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="23211" xml_f="23600" txt_i="16055" txt_f="16444">was assessed by three different measures.

To detect a mean difference of at least 2.5 points on fall-related self-efficacy between the intervention and control group (SD is 6.0; equivalent to an effect size of .42), at least 117 participants in each group were necessary to meet a power of 80 percent at alpha .01 (one-sided). Taking a dropout rate of 30 percent during the trial into account, a total number of 180 participants per group (n = 360) were needed to enrol in the trial.

A total of 7431 older persons rightfully received the screening questionnaire. The response rate was 58.9 percent. During the course of the study the number of people who were sent a screening questionnaire was increased based on two grounds. First, in contrast to our estimate of 14.5 percent, only about 10 percent of the participants in the first cycle met our eligibility criteria and were willing to participate. Second, about 25 percent of the persons participating in the baseline measurement dropped out before randomisation. In total, 540 participants were included in the trial; 260 participants were allocated to the intervention group and 280 to the control group. The data collection was completed in February 2005. Currently, preparations for the analyses of the data of the screening and process evaluation are being made. Data of the effect evaluation will be available in 2005.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="48079" xml_f="48100" txt_i="28346" txt_f="28367">Future implementation</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48111" xml_f="48539" txt_i="28368" txt_f="28796">Implementation in the Dutch setting has been taken into account throughout the development of AMB-NL (Zijlstra et al., development of intervention protocol, submitted).
