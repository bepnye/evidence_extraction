E2 concentrations were higher at each time point in women with positive outcomes, but the difference was not statistically significant. Both protocols are able to maintain low concentrations of progesterone for the duration of the stimulation and this is important to avoid premature luteinization, which could reduce the pregnancy rate by prematurely closing the window for implantation. Moreover, we observed a significant difference between pregnant and non-pregnant women at each time point, with a progressive linear increase in progesterone levels during ovarian stimulation in women with positive pregnancy outcomes. There is a growing consensus that high P levels at the end of the follicular phase are detrimental to clinical outcome (</offsets><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36000" xml_f="36002" txt_i="19623" txt_f="19625">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36009" xml_f="36011" txt_i="19625" txt_f="19627">, </offsets><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36043" xml_f="36045" txt_i="19627" txt_f="19629">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36052" xml_f="36110" txt_i="19629" txt_f="19687">-22).

Oocyte number and maturity are not influenced by GnRH antagonist protocols, but lower age and a larger pool of recruitable follicles predict successful impregnation.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research did not receive any specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sector.</p></ack><sec><title>Note</title><p>
