is made from the amino acid L-arginine by the enzymatic action of NO synthase (NOS). NO
makes a band with sulfur-iron complexes, but due to production of steroid sexual hormones
related to the enzymes involved in this complex, NO can change the activity of these enzymes.
NO affects many cells including vein endothelial cells, macrophages and mast cells. These
cells are also found in Leydig cells; therefore, they are important source of NO in testis tissue.
Therefore, minimizing damages to sperm at the time of freezing thawing process are really important. The aim of this study was to determine the appropriate NO concentration to be added
to the freezing extender to improve the quality of thawed sperm.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4616" xml_f="4637" txt_i="814" txt_f="835">Materials and Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4648" xml_f="5172" txt_i="836" txt_f="1357">In this experimental randomized study, sperms of four Holstein

Sperm was collected twice a week for 3 weeks.
Then samples were transferred to laboratory rapidly

semen volume, population and sperm motility of
each bull were determined, samples were mixed,
divided in four aliquots, and diluted using Bioxell
(Bioxell Inc., USA) containing various concentrations
of sodium nitroprusside (SNP). So, four SNP
treatments including 0 (control), 10, 50 and 100
nmol/ml were studied for 6 weeks (replications).
After dilution and packing in 0.5 cc pivots, 2 pivots
of each sample were transferred to laboratory,
and quality and quantity of sperms were analyzed
using computer-aided system analysis (CASA).
Samples were then frozen using digital freezer
and kept in nitrogen tanks. At least after 24 hours,
thawed samples were incubated and motility percentage,
viability, acrosome status and MDA level
were analyzed at 0, 1, 2, and 3 hours being kept at
37˚C. Freezing or cry therapy is a process of longterm
preservation of cells and tissues at very low

studying lipid per oxidation process, we found that

eliminating these radicals lead to reactive oxygen

oxidative stress that results in damage of proteins, membrane lipids and other cell components (</offsets><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="32423" xml_f="32425" txt_i="15995" txt_f="15997">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32432" xml_f="32636" txt_i="15997" txt_f="16201">).
