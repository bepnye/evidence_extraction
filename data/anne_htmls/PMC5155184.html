The symptoms resolved immediately after termination of nitrous oxide inhalation and inhalation of pure oxygen, with no decline in oxygen saturation after the restart of nitrous oxide inhalation. No patients developed severe hypoxemia, bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 50 bpm), systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg during the examination process, or tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 120 bpm).

Numerous studies have demonstrated unique advantages of EUS for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal submucosal tumors.

However, the use of a long hard endoscope means that it is much more uncomfortable than general gastroscopy, and cannot be tolerated by some patients. Although EUS can be performed under intravenous propofol anesthesia, some lesions can only be displayed clearly after gastric infusion of water, which increases the risk of aspiration during intravenous propofol anesthesia. The success rate of EUS could therefore be improved by establishing a method for reducing pain and discomfort and increasing patient tolerance.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23938" xml_f="24716" txt_i="13846" txt_f="14624">Nitrous oxide is an inhaled sedative and analgesic agent, which passes through the blood-brain barrier into the brain and functions by inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitter release and nerve impulse conduction in the central nervous system, and altering the permeability of ion channels. Nitrous oxide does not stimulate the respiratory tract or bind to hemoglobin, and does not cause respiratory depression or damage heart, lung, liver, or kidney function. Nitrous oxide sedation is currently used widely in clinical situations, including in emergency surgery, dentistry, childbirth, abortion and curettage, and pediatrics, and can also be applied for gastrointestinal endoscopic sedation.
