Assuming an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 10% a study sample consisting of 8 schools (4 intervention schools and 4 control schools) is required.

With the SOPLAY protocol the playground will be scanned for child density and playground use every five minutes. One scan, including notation, takes one minute.

The playground will be actually modified. In addition, playground usage will be increased through an altered time management of recess times, as well as a modification of the content of PE lessons.

An analysis of the existing playground will provide information for the new designs that will be applied to the playground. Examples of designs are a soccer field, a basketball set-shot area, a circle for circular activities, a dance area, a throw and catch area, a rope skipping area and a bounce area. By using a set of predefined markings a playground is re-created that is appealing to children of all age groups represented in this study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18158" xml_f="18515" txt_i="12785" txt_f="13142">The basic idea behind all modifications is to give structure to the playground. This will ensure that the available space is divided between children, such that compatible activities are clustered in the available space. In addition this benefits the choice for different games, as the setting of the games can be situated on the most ideal playground spot.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18522" xml_f="19120" txt_i="13143" txt_f="13741">Some designs will be named as "hotspots". A hotspot is a place where the majority of children would like to play (e.g. a soccer field). Usage of hotspots will be spread over the different classes, so all children will have the opportunity to play at a hotspot once a week. Also the recess available time will be divided between the different classes. This will create more relative playground space and allows for more intensive play opportunity per child. Once a week teachers will be playing together with the children. Once a month parents will be invited to join the children at the playground.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19127" xml_f="19637" txt_i="13742" txt_f="14252">A specific PE program will further support the intervention. Themes of activities will be scheduled and the regular lessons of PE will present ideas on how to use the playground, fitting the theme of the month (for example rope skipping in April). The weekly frequency of regular PE is two times with a duration of forty-five minutes per PE lesson. To further support the playground activities each class will have a box with playground attributes (for example ropes and balls) used in the physical activities.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19659" xml_f="19675" txt_i="14254" txt_f="14270">Outcome measures</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19686" xml_f="19837" txt_i="14271" txt_f="14422">The primary outcome measure of this study is PA levels of children during recess.

During the researchers' fortnight visit of the schools, a total of 40 children of all ages (8 per grade) will be randomly chosen to wear an accelerometer during the school day. This is an arbitrarily chosen number, based upon the organisational ability to perform these measurements on a single day by the available research staff. The Actitrainer will be set at an epoch of 1 second to measure every change in intensity and the display will be turned off, so children will not be distracted by the Actitrainer. The Actitrainer will be called a 'growing meter' or a 'honesty meter', so children will not be stimulated to be more active just because of wearing the Actitrainer.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21490" xml_f="22157" txt_i="15969" txt_f="16636">Through these measurements it is possible to objectively register intensity and duration of PA during recess. Existing analytical CSA programs (e.g. MAHUffe) are not usable to analyse the thus obtained data, as recess time only lasts 15 minutes. These current commercial programs are set to analyse PA during a prolonged period of time, e.g. 5 consecutive days. For this reason a dedicated Matlab program to analyse the number of counts during the short recess time was written. This Matlab program analyses the counts per minute for every child, and combines the resulting data with date of measurement, total time of measurement and grade, age and sex of the child.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22185" xml_f="22199" txt_i="16639" txt_f="16653">Questionnaires</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22210" xml_f="22557" txt_i="16654" txt_f="17001">A baseline questionnaire will be completed by the 9 to 12 year old children before they will perform the physical fitness test.

The bent arm hang is performed in the MOPER test and in the EUROFIT test with an elevated horizontal bar, but will be performed in this study at a rope instead of an elevated horizontal bar. Children step from a chair to bent arm hang in the rope and the time in bent arm hang will be recorded until the arms are not bent anymore. These tests give an overall image of the fitness of children (coordination, flexibility, endurance, strength and speed). The choice for these tests is based upon the organisational ability to perform these measurements within two PE lessons and to get a reliable result with different test leaders. A 20 m endurance Shuttle Run (EUROFIT) is performed instead of a 6 minute run (MOPER), because a warming-up is integrated in the Shuttle Run test. The flamingo balance test, the sit-ups in 30 seconds test (EUROFIT) and the leg lifting test (MOPER) have been left out because of the difficulty to get an objective result with different test leaders; the PWC170 (EUROFIT) has been left out, because a bike ergo meter test is not practical within two PE lessons; the vertical jump and the one-arm pull (MOPER) have been left out, because these tests measure the same construct as the standing broad jump and the handgrip test.
