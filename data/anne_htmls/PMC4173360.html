Tracheal intubation using a laryngoscope inevitably alters the anatomy in order to bring the glottis in the line of sight. In addition, tracheal tube is designed for ease of intubation when the anatomy is thus altered and as a result its curvature does not always correspond with the contours of the relaxed anatomy of the upper airway.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1"><offsets xml_i="5709" xml_f="5710" txt_i="1676" txt_f="1677">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5717" xml_f="5718" txt_i="1677" txt_f="1678">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5725" xml_f="6060" txt_i="1679" txt_f="2014">With the aim to create a new airway system with better intubation characteristics than laryngeal mask airway (LMA), Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway (ILMA) was introduced by Dr. A. I. J. Brain in 1997. Other design goals were to eliminate the need for head and neck manipulation and insertion of fingers in the mouth during placement.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2"><offsets xml_i="6093" xml_f="6094" txt_i="2014" txt_f="2015">2</offsets></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3"><offsets xml_i="6134" xml_f="6135" txt_i="2015" txt_f="2016">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6142" xml_f="6143" txt_i="2016" txt_f="2017">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6150" xml_f="7209" txt_i="2018" txt_f="3077">The principal features of this system are an anatomically curved, rigid airway tube with an integrating handle, an epiglottis elevating bar, guiding ramp built into floor of mask aperture and silicone tracheal tube. The rigid bore tube permits the mask to be guided during endotracheal intubation and accommodates a normal sized tracheal tube. The tube curvature is specifically designed to fit into the palatopharyngeal arch, producing a firm seal. The guiding handle allows single-handed insertion, removal and positional adjustments during intubation. The epiglottic elevating bar replaces the three aperture bars of the standard LMA. It acts as an epiglottic ramp during insertion, keeps epiglottis from obstructing the airway, protects and elevates the epiglottis during tracheal tube passage. The wide, short tube offers less work of breathing and allows passage of larger instruments into the respiratory tract. The insertion technique is simpler and may be achieved by same rotational maneuver from any position that is useful when access is limited.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3"><offsets xml_i="7242" xml_f="7243" txt_i="3077" txt_f="3078">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7250" xml_f="7251" txt_i="3078" txt_f="3079">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7258" xml_f="7575" txt_i="3080" txt_f="3397">This new device has been specially designed to aid blind and fiberscopic-guided tracheal intubation.

The difficulty in viewing the larynx which underlies failed laryngoscopic intubation is probably irrelevant to ILMA placement and subsequent intubation. Currently no single test can assess the prediction of difficult intubation, therefore, difficult intubation will continue to occur in an unpredictable fashion. The priority remains to provide adequate training and equipment to manage unexpected failure. ILMA had been proved useful in cases of failed and difficult intubation.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4"><offsets xml_i="8210" xml_f="8211" txt_i="3953" txt_f="3954">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8218" xml_f="8219" txt_i="3954" txt_f="3955">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8226" xml_f="8384" txt_i="3956" txt_f="4114">Moreover, ILMA-guided intubation may avoid or alleviate the mechanical stimuli to the oropharyngeal structures, which are inevitable while using a rigid DLS.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1"><offsets xml_i="8417" xml_f="8418" txt_i="4114" txt_f="4115">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8425" xml_f="8633" txt_i="4115" txt_f="4323">] DLS to facilitate tracheal intubation produces marked pressor response.

The insertion technique consisted of a one-handed rotational movement in the sagittal plane, with the head supported by the pillow. Specifically, the mask was fully deflated with the rim facing posteriorly. A bolus of water-soluble lubricant was applied posteriorly to the tip, which was then flattened against the palate with no attempt made to push the device inward until the saucer-shaped depression had been seen to be inverted against the palatal surface, drawing back slightly to ensure complete flattening of the rim into the dome of palate. The ILMA was then rotated inward, following the arc of the palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall, and the cuff was inflated with 20–30 ml of air (size 3: 20 ml; size 4: 30 ml). Successful placement–ventilatory ability was judged by the chest wall movement and capnography during manually assisted ventilation. If airway was not maintained, adjustment of ILMA as well as head was done. This was followed by insertion of lubricated 7.0, 7.5 or 8.0 mm PVC endotracheal tube through the metal tube of the ILMA gently without applying undue forces. If no resistance was felt, the cuff was inflated and circuit reconnected. Capnographic confirmation of the tracheal tube placement was sought. If resistance was felt or esophageal intubation occurred, a predetermined sequence of adjusting maneuvers was performed. Then, the ILMA was removed over the endotracheal tube and air entry with the endotracheal tube was reconfirmed. When tracheal intubation was not successful after three attempts, the patients were intubated with conventional laryngoscopy. In the Group DLS, Direct Laryngoscopy was done with Macintosh laryngoscope and intubation was done with a cuffed endotracheal tube of appropriate size with head and neck in neutral position. In both the study groups, maintenance of anesthesia was done with nitrous oxide and oxygen and halothane with pancuronium as muscle relaxant. At the end of the surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed with a mixture of atropine (0.02 mg/kg) and neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and extubation was done. Parameters studied were ease of intubation, time taken for intubation and hemodynamic parameters. Ease of intubation was assessed by recording the number of attempts required to intubate the patients’ trachea and the degree of manipulation needed to achieve intubation. Time taken for intubation was assessed as follows. Group ILMA – Time between removal of face mask and ILMA insertion and time between disconnection of ILMA from the breathing system to successful tracheal intubation and ILMA removal.
