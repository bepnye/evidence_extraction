By using intermittent diazepam there is a clinical disincentive to overdosage as administration of each dose is a deliberate action by the bedside nurse. Continuous infusions of sedatives are more convenient but risk oversedation if the infusion rate is not regularly reduced to test the lower limit of acceptable sedation. In terms of cost, diazepam has a clear advantage being one-tenth the price and having twice the potency. Because of cost and the prolonged elimination half life of midazolam in the critically ill, our standard sedative regimen has been intermittent intravenous diazepam, but midazolam by continuous intravenous infusion may also be used at the discretion of the duty ICU specialist. We set out to compare these two regimens in our patient population in a pilot study in 40 patients to evaluate the regimens, to allow power calculations for future studies and to evaluate study design.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><offsets xml_i="7943" xml_f="7964" txt_i="4602" txt_f="4623">Materials and methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7975" xml_f="8699" txt_i="4624" txt_f="5348">The study was approved by the Royal North Shore Hospital and Community Health Services Human Research Ethics Committee.

Intermittent dosing imposes additional nursing work but makes accumulation less likely, and inappropriately prolonged sedation due to intermittent diazepam was not seen in this study. Administration by continuous infusion is more convenient, may provided a more uniform level of sedation, but risks greater drug use and accumulation if sedation level is not closely monitored. Our study supports these theoretical differences. Some of the results are inconclusive due to the small sample size and the heterogeneity of a general ICU population.

Studies conducted in our unit suggest that patients surviving ICU are disturbed by having no memory of that period of their life [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="24057" xml_f="24059" txt_i="16020" txt_f="16022">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24066" xml_f="24630" txt_i="16022" txt_f="16586">]. Thus, what appears to medical and nursing staff to be an ideal sedative agent, in particular more recently available short-acting anaesthetic agents which provide titratable sedation, but by nature of their very short duration of action allow patients to be heavily sedated without the risk of significant accumulation, may encourage staff to oversedate patients. Despite the patients being 'well-sedated', they may later be disturbed by having no memory whatsoever of their time in ICU. This is an area of ICU practice that requires considerable further study.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anonymous</surname><given-names></given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is this the end of research as we know it? </article-title><source>BMJ</source><year>1</year><volume>315</volume><fpage>388</fpage></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Knottnerus</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Dinant</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Medicine based evidence, a prerequisite for evidence based medicine: future research methods must find ways of accommodating clinical reality, not ignoring it.</article-title><source>BMJ</source><year>1997</year><volume>315</volume><fpage>1109</fpage><lpage>1110</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9374881</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barrientos-Vega</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanchez-Soria</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Morales-Garcia</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Robas-Gomez</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Cuena-Boy</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Ayensa-Rincon</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prolonged sedation of critically ill patients with midazolam or propofol: impact on weaning and costs.</article-title><source>Crit Care Med</source><year>1997</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>33</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8989173</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B4"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cernaianu</surname><given-names>AC</given-names></name><name><surname>DelRossi</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Flum</surname><given-names>DR</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>Lorazepam and midazolam in the intensive care unit: a randomized, prospective, multi-center study of hemodynamics, oxygen transport, efficacy, and cost. </article-title><source>Crit Care Med</source><year>1996</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>222</fpage><lpage>228</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8605792</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B5"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hansen-Flaschen</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Brazinsky</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Basile</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lanken</surname><given-names>PN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Use of sedating drugs and neuromuscular blocking agents in patients requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure.
