For example, the blind pacifier condition yielded an average aEEG maxima in left and right hemisphere of 12.89 µV and 12.81 µV, respectively, whereas the addition of the patterned orocutaneous stimulation yielded an average aEEG maxima of 11.68 µV and 13.38 µV, respectively (p&lt;.001). Based on the individual hemispheric measures, the presence of the pulsatile oral somatosensory stimulation, distinct from a blind pacifier alone, alters the balance in excitation with significant attenuation of the aEEG in the left hemisphere and slight facilitation in the right hemisphere. This translates to an interhemispheric difference of 1.7 µV during pulsatile oral somatosensory stimulation and only 0.08 µV in the presence of a blind pacifier (p&lt;.001). The crosshead measure did not detect the cortical asymmetry. Behaviorally, the orocutaneous stimulation had a calming effect for preterm infants who began the stimulation period in the quiet-alert state and often transitioned to a drowsy-sleep state.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="S14"><title><offsets xml_i="18831" xml_f="18851" txt_i="12777" txt_f="12797">rEEG amplitude bands</offsets></title><p id="P18"><offsets xml_i="18871" xml_f="19019" txt_i="12798" txt_f="12946">The presence of the patterned pneumatic orocutaneous stimulation produced a significant reorganization of rEEG amplitude bands in both hemispheres (</offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4"><offsets xml_i="19049" xml_f="19058" txt_i="12946" txt_f="12955">Figures 4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19065" xml_f="19070" txt_i="12955" txt_f="12960"> and </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"><offsets xml_i="19100" xml_f="19101" txt_i="12960" txt_f="12961">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19108" xml_f="19507" txt_i="12961" txt_f="13360">).
