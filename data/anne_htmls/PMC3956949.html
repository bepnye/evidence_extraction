This may partially be attributed to better quality of life. Stone incidence also varies with race, ethnicity, and geographic region. Men are affected twice as commonly as women, with peak incidence being at 30 years of age. Ureteral stones contribute to 20% of all urinary tract stones, 70% of which are located in the distal ureter. Fifty percent of patients have a recurrence of renal colic within 5 years of the first episode. Urolithiasis is a chronic disease with substantial economic consequences and great public health importance [</offsets><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6248" xml_f="6249" txt_i="2320" txt_f="2321">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6256" xml_f="6258" txt_i="2321" txt_f="2323">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6265" xml_f="6831" txt_i="2324" txt_f="2890">Medical expulsive therapy developed after an understanding of the various physiologic and pathophysiologic bases for urinary stones. The ureter is lined by smooth muscle cells with alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, especially in the distal third. Receptor blockade inhibits both basal smooth muscle tone and hyperperistaltic uncoordinated frequency in order to maintain tonic propulsive contractions. Ureteric calculi can induce ureteric spasms that interfere with expulsion; thus, muscle relaxation while maintaining normal peristaltic activity may facilitate passage [</offsets><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6862" xml_f="6863" txt_i="2890" txt_f="2891">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6870" xml_f="6871" txt_i="2891" txt_f="2892">,</offsets><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6902" xml_f="6903" txt_i="2892" txt_f="2893">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6910" xml_f="7188" txt_i="2893" txt_f="3171">]. Therefore, alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonists work by creating an increased pressure gradient around the stone, which propels distal ureteral stones out of the ureter.

Patients in group A were given tamsulosin 0.4 mg once daily, and those in group B were given tamsulosin 0.4 mg and tadalafil 10 mg once daily. In addition, patients in groups A and B received prednisolone 5 mg once daily for 1 week. In both groups, drugs were continued until stone expulsion or for a maximum of 6 weeks. During the study, one patient in each group dropped out. All patients were evaluated by physical examination; serum creatinine; urine culture; plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB); ultrasonography; and noncontrast computed tomography of the KUB region. All patients presenting with ureteral colic were given pain relief with intramuscular diclofenac. Patients were instructed to filter their urine by using a standard mesh net to detect stone expulsion. The expulsion time; analgesic use; number of hospital visits for pain, follow-up, and endoscopic treatment; and adverse effects of drugs were noted. The maximum duration of follow-up was 6 weeks, after which patients underwent semirigid ureterorenoscopy for removal of stones that were not expelled. The primary outcome studied was the stone expulsion rate. Secondary endpoints were stone expulsion time, number of pain episodes, analgesic use, and self-reported side effects related to medical therapy.
