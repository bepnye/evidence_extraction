mobilization techniques for improving pain and range of motion in patients with frozen
shoulders. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were 20 patients with frozen shoulder who
visited Hospital H, Ulsan, Korea. The subjects were divided randomly into two groups to
receive Maitland or Kaltenborn mobilization to the affected shoulder. Grade III
anteroposterior oscillation and posterior translation were used for the Maitland and
Kaltenborn mobilization groups, respectively. Pain and range of motion of external and
internal rotation were evaluated pre- and post-intervention in both groups. Paired t-tests
were used to compare the pre- and post-intervention results in both groups, and
independent t-tests were used to compare groups. [Results] Both groups exhibited
significant decreases in pain post-intervention. Moreover, the range of motion of internal
and external rotation increased significantly post-intervention in both groups. However,
there was no significant difference between groups with respect to pain improvement or
range of motion. [Conclusion] The posterior Maitland and Kaltenborn mobilization
techniques are effective for improving pain and range of motion in frozen shoulder
patients. Therefore, we recommend both techniques for such patients.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Maitland mobilization</kwd><kwd>Kaltenborn mobilization</kwd><kwd>Frozen shoulder</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="5006" xml_f="5018" txt_i="1368" txt_f="1380">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5029" xml_f="5201" txt_i="1381" txt_f="1553">Frozen shoulder (FS), more formally termed adhesive capsulitis, is a disease that causes

usually shows the most severe loss. There are the previous studies for the application of
joint mobilization related to the rotation defect of shoulder joint among FS patients. Joint
mobilization, which is often used to treat FS patients, can be divided into the oscillatory
technique suggested by Maitland</offsets><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7275" xml_f="7276" txt_i="3203" txt_f="3204">9</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="7288" xml_f="7289" txt_i="3204" txt_f="3205">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="7295" xml_f="7355" txt_i="3205" txt_f="3265"> and the

techniques are both passive treatments, but they differ in that MM uses oscillation while KM
uses sustained stretching.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7598" xml_f="8682" txt_i="3453" txt_f="4537">MM applies a passive oscillatory technique, classified from Grade I–IV with respect to
intensity, to the shoulder in order to treat pain and stiffness. Grade I refers to an
intensity of small amplitude that is applied at the beginning of the joint ROM, where there
is no loading on connective tissue; it is often used in cases of severe pain. Meanwhile,
Grade II refers to an intensity of slightly larger amplitude applied from the beginning of
the joint ROM to the middle. Grade I and II oscillation stimuli provoke the mechanical
receptor of the joint, restricting the nocuous stimulus that generates the pain stimulus,
which is transmitted to the central nervous system; therefore, it is appropriate for
relieving pain. Grade III is applied at a large amplitude from the middle of the joint ROM
to the beginning of the restriction. Finally, Grade IV is applied against the tissue
resistance at a small amplitude to the restricted part of the joint. Grade III and IV
oscillation stimuli are used for provoking a stretching to relieve joint stiffness by
applying in a shorter tissue.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8689" xml_f="8910" txt_i="4538" txt_f="4759">On the other hand, KM evaluates the motions on the articular surface and applies them to

KM involves the application of a passive sustained stretch
technique to enhance joint mobility without articular surface suppression. The forces
applied to increase joint mobility are graded from I–III. Grade I applies a distraction of
minor intensity that hardly causes stress within the joint capsule; it is often used to
decrease pain. Grade II refers to a force that stretches the periarticular tissue; such
stimulus is colloquially referred to as “taking up the slack.” Finally, Grade III force
causes enough distraction or gliding so that joint capsule can sufficiently stretch; it is
often used for enhancing ROM</offsets><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9616" xml_f="9618" txt_i="5383" txt_f="5385">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9625" xml_f="9627" txt_i="5385" txt_f="5387">, </offsets><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9659" xml_f="9661" txt_i="5387" txt_f="5389">12</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="9673" xml_f="9674" txt_i="5389" txt_f="5390">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="9680" xml_f="9681" txt_i="5390" txt_f="5391">.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9688" xml_f="9815" txt_i="5392" txt_f="5519">Several studies have investigated the treatment effects of joint mobilization to the

pain during motion, even though they possess chronic pain. Therefore, to measure pain
intensity, each patient was instructed to execute shoulder flexion, internal rotation, and
external rotation three times and then directly note the pain intensity. Regarding
quantification, the patient marked the pain intensity he/she felt on a 10-cm line; the left

passive joint ROM was measured with the elbow joint at 90° flexion, external rotation at 90°
abduction, and internal rotation at 90° abduction. The angle between the forearm and a line
vertical to the therapeutic table was measured. However, as the majority of FS patients
presented with broad shoulder ROM defects with shoulder abduction limited to less than 90°,
the rotation was performed at the maximum degree possible when 90° was not possible. The
tester recorded the baseline abduction degree of the shoulder of each subject, which was
always passively located at the baseline abduction degree before measurement. This method
was chosen because of the variability in the ROM defect in FS patients. Any abnormal
movement in the scapula was prevented in order to maintain a stable shoulder abduction
degree. The humerus moved passively while maintaining a neutral position. Next, in order to
measure the external and internal rotations, the coracoid and clavicle were pressed by one
hand to stabilize the scapula, while the forearm was rotated toward the foot and head in
cases of internal and external rotation, respectively, by the other hand to measure the
passive joint ROM. The point where forearm rotation stopped differed in each patient

effective for increasing shoulder internal rotation in normal individuals. Thus, the
posterior translation applied in the present study likely contributed to the increased
internal rotation by stretching the posterior capsule.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28327" xml_f="28648" txt_i="18550" txt_f="18871">In the case of the Grade III anteroposterior oscillation in MM, both the external and
internal rotation ROMs increased significantly post-intervention, similar to that after KM.
This can be interpreted to mean that MM provokes tissue stretching even though it uses
oscillation and produces results similar to those of KM.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28655" xml_f="29331" txt_i="18872" txt_f="19548">The limitations of this study are as follows. First, the sample size was not large enough
to generalize the study results to other populations. Second, even though patients were
selected according to strict inclusion criteria, the strength of the third stage of
mobilization differed according to each patient’s recovery. Third, the study allowed all
movements during daily activities and was therefore unable to control for the diverse
motions of each patient. Finally, the direction of mobilization applied for treatment was
not diverse enough. Future studies involving FS patients should investigate mobilization in
various directions in addition to posterior mobilization.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29338" xml_f="29775" txt_i="19549" txt_f="19986">In summary, anteroposterior MM and KM reduced pain and improved ROM in FS patients.
Therefore, these techniques are effective for improving FS-associated joint contracture and
pain. However, there was no significant difference between the MM and KM techniques with
respect to pain reduction or ROM improvement. Therefore, we recommend both anteroposterior
MM and KM be considered for ROM improvement and pain reduction among FS patients.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Daegu University Research Grant, 2012.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Wadsworth</surname><given-names>CT</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Frozen shoulder</article-title>. <source>Phys
