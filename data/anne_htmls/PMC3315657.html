Before the induction of anaesthesia, 1 ml of normal saline was injected in patients assigned to group R and dexamethasone (5 mg in 1 ml) was injected in patients assigned to group RD. Injected drugs were prepared in 1 ml syringes by anesthetic nurses who were not involved in this study. Anaesthesia was induced with 1.5-2.0 mg/kg of propofol, and 0.5-1 µg/kg of remifentanil, and tracheal intubation was facilitated with 0.9 mg/kg of rocuronium. Patients' lungs were mechanically ventilated with oxygen and air (inspired oxygen fraction 0.4), a tidal volume of 6-8 ml/kg, and I : E ratio of 1 : 2.0 at a respiratory rate of 8-12 breaths/min to maintain normocarbia throughout operation. Anaesthesia was maintained with continuous infusion of remifentanil (0.05-0.2 µg/kg/min), rocuronium (5-6 µg/kg/min), and sevoflurane (1.5-2.5%). At the end of the operation, all patients received ramosetron (0.3 mg) and PCA was initiated. The PCA regimen consisted of fentanyl (25 µg/kg), ketorolac (120 mg) and ramosetron (0.3 mg; total volume including saline, 100 ml). The IV PCA was programmed to deliver 2 ml/h as background infusion and 1 ml per demand with a 15 min lockout for a 48 h period. As patients were placed in the supine position, sevoflurane was discontinued and remifentanil was infused continuously at a reduced infusion rate (0.02-0.05 µg/kg/min).

Secondary efficacy variables included use of additional antiemetic rescues, pain intensity and medication-associated complications. These variables were assessed by two investigators who were blinded to treatment group. Evaluations were performed at the following 4 time periods: during the stay in the recovery room and in the ward at approximately 6 h, 6-24 h, and 24-48 h. Nausea was defined as subjectively unpleasant sensation associated with awareness of the urge to vomit and an emetic episode was defined as a single episode of vomiting (the forceful expulsion of gastric contents through the mouth). Retching, which was considered as vomiting, was defined as an expulsive movement of the stomach muscles when no stomach contents were expelled. The intensity of nausea was graded on verbal rating scales (VRS) using an 11 point scale, with 0 = no nausea to 10 = worst possible nausea. The severity of nausea was graded on VRS: mild (1-3), moderate (4-6), and severe (7-10). Pain intensity scores were measured using a visual analog scale (VAS) that ranged from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (worst pain imaginable). Rescue antiemetic therapy (metoclopromide 10 mg, IV) was given at the discretion of the attending physicians, who were blinded to the patients' group, in response to nausea, vomiting or at the patient's request. IV PCA was discontinued when severe nausea persisted and/or upon patient's request after 2 consecutive boluses of metoclopromide.

The effect of dexamethasone added to ramosetron in patients using opioid-based IV PCA with high susceptibility for PONV was evaluated first in this study and several beneficial effects could be demonstrated. The combination of ramosetron and dexamethasone could significantly reduce the incidence of moderate to severe nausea and vomiting compared to ramosetron alone. In addition, there was a trend toward less use of rescue antiemetic agents in the combination group. The finding that the incidence of moderate to severe nausea was significantly lower in the combination group seems to be promising considering that moderate to severe nausea comes just before vomiting and that it is vomiting which causes dehydration, disruption of the surgical repair, and increases the perception of pain [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="22120" xml_f="22121" txt_i="15708" txt_f="15709">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22128" xml_f="22129" txt_i="15709" txt_f="15710">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="22160" xml_f="22161" txt_i="15710" txt_f="15711">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22168" xml_f="22170" txt_i="15711" txt_f="15713">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22177" xml_f="22436" txt_i="15714" txt_f="15973">Total incidence of PONV, however, was not different between the groups and still half of the patients developed PONV even with combination therapy in this study.
