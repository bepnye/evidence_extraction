Recent studies, primarily observational, have suggested that skeletonization of the ITA can improve conduit flow, increase length, and reduce the risk of deep sternal infection in high risk patients. Furthermore, skeletonization of the ITA can potentially preserve intercostal nerves and reduce post-operative pain and dysesthesias associated with ITA harvesting.

Direct blood flow from each ITA will be measured upon division by measuring the amount of blood filling a calibrated cup over 15 seconds. The ITAs will then be treated with a vasodilator, papaverine, applied topically, in order to eliminate any vasospasm that may occur due to the handling as well as mechanical or thermal trauma to the vessel. The third flow measurement will be performed after a 5–10 minute treatment with papaverine (equal duration of treatment for both ITAs) using the direct flow technique described above.

Post-anastomotic Doppler flows are further dependent on the size of the outflow vessel, the degree of distal disease and the size and vasoreactive characteristics of the distal myocardial bed that is supplied. Recognizing these potential sources of inaccuracies, pre-anastomotic direct flow (before papaverine treatment) measured from both ITAs at approximately the same time will be used as the primary outcome measure.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="13074" xml_f="13105" txt_i="8797" txt_f="8828">Chest wall pain and dysesthesia</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="13116" xml_f="13714" txt_i="8829" txt_f="9427">Assessments of chest wall pain and dysesthesia will be performed by a blinded observer.

In this paper, we describe the rationale and study protocol, utilizing a paired study design for the evaluation of skeletonized versus non-skeletonized harvest of the internal thoracic artery. The primary outcome measure for this study is intra-operative ITA flow. Additional outcome measures include ITA length, sternal perfusion, and post-operative pain and dysesthesias. The strengths of this study include the assessment of multiple clinically relevant endpoints using an efficient study design with within-patient comparisons.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19289" xml_f="19311" txt_i="14495" txt_f="14517">Limitations of ITA use</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="19322" xml_f="19961" txt_i="14518" txt_f="15157">The use of ITAs as bypass conduits has been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes following coronary artery bypass surgery. However, there are several potential reasons that limit the utilization of the ITA. First, the pre-disposition of the ITAs to post-operative vasospasm and hypoperfusion can potentially be amplified in the presence of vasoactive medications and therefore, there is some reluctance to using these conduits in patients undergoing emergency surgery as well as those with poor left ventricular function. Catastrophic consequences of ITA hypoperfusion, including death and cardiac transplantation, have been reported[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="19992" xml_f="19993" txt_i="15157" txt_f="15158">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20000" xml_f="20222" txt_i="15158" txt_f="15380">].

The paired study design is efficient because it eliminates the effects of between-patient variability and therefore, significantly reduces the number of patients required to detect a difference in the primary endpoint. This design shares many features of cross-over studies, which are often used to assess effects of medications (e.g. blood pressure lowering medications) that are relatively short acting and being used to treat a disease that is relatively stable over time (e.g. hypertension). In cross-over studies, all patients receive both treatments, and the order in which treatments are administered is randomly assigned. The major concerns with this study design are a) carry over effects i.e. persistence of the effects of the first treatment while the second treatment is being administered, and b) changes in the disease state over the treatment periods. The addition of a washout period between treatments, when no treatment is administered, helps to allay some of this concern[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="24524" xml_f="24526" txt_i="19009" txt_f="19011">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24533" xml_f="24683" txt_i="19011" txt_f="19161">].

Our study design shares a number of features of a cross-over study in that each patient receives both treatments, the order in which treatments are administered is randomized, and the outcomes are assessed according to treatment assignment in a side-specific manner. Although it provides an efficient study design, an important implicit assumption of this design is that the organs that receive the intervention are the same i.e. in this case, that the left and right ITAs are the same, both at the pre-treatment stage and with respect to their response to treatment. Although this assumption seems intuitively reasonable, there are certain anatomic differences between the origins of the left and right ITAs that may question this assumption and this is a limitation of this study design. To address this issue, the randomization scheme will stratify according to side (left versus right) to ensure equivalent numbers in both groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26096" xml_f="26948" txt_i="20484" txt_f="21336">Another limitation is the inability to assess the effects of skeletonization on sternal wound infections and other endpoints that are not side-specific. Nevertheless, this design allows for the control of various systemic factors that are identical between the two ITAs. These factors include patient size, the presence of diabetes, hypertension, and other cardiovascular risk factors, the systemic consequences of surgical trauma, systemic endogenous release or exogenous administration of vasoactive substances, and particularly important in our case, the subjective pain experience of each individual in response to surgery. A unique feature of this type of paired study is that the treatments are administered at roughly the same time and therefore, period effects are not expected to play a major role in confounding treatment related differences.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26970" xml_f="26977" txt_i="21338" txt_f="21345">Summary</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26988" xml_f="27710" txt_i="21346" txt_f="22068">Skeletonization of the internal thoracic artery is a new surgical technique that can potentially improve the quality of the ITA as a bypass conduit as well as reduce post-operative morbidity. Although advantages of this technique have been suggested in observational studies, definitive data supporting its benefits is lacking. As such, there is significant variation between surgeons in the harvesting technique employed.
