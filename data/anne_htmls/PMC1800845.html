Due to its intrinsic properties, it appears to be a good option for newborns. First, its onset of action is only 30 to 45 minutes. Second, it has no risk of methemoglobinemia. In addition, it causes local vasodilatation, which may be an advantage in newborns as it can be a challenge to obtain IV access or blood.
