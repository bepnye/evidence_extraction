Patients were then referred to the phlebotomy laboratory of the adjacent hospital to have a blood sample taken. At the first appointment, patients were also given a study questionnaire. They were asked to return the questionnaire at the second appointment 1 week later. At the second appointment, patients only had to go the phlebotomy laboratory to have a blood sample taken. Follow-up assessments were scheduled 4 and 8 months after baseline. After completion of baseline assessments (September 2002 to December 2002), an independent researcher randomly assigned all 146 patients to the intervention group or the control group by using a computerized table. The control and intervention groups each comprised 6 pairs of participants (12 individuals) living at the same address and/or with the same surname. Patients within each pair were randomized into the same group to avoid contamination of the information within families or households. The randomization procedure resulted in 73 patients in the intervention group and 73 patients in the control group. Patients in the control group received usual care. In addition to usual care, patients in the intervention group were given a personal registration code for the password-protected access to a Web-based nutrition counselling and social support program (Heartweb) that was specifically designed for this study. After 4 months, patients were sent a reminder of their registration code. At each time point, patients in the intervention group and those in the control group were sent result sheets with their body mass index, blood pressure and cholesterol values.

Similar to the previous study, patients in the current study were told that the study was aimed at assessing nutrition-counselling practices in general practice.

Patients were then automatically presented with an information package for that particular stage of change. Figure 2 shows an example of the personalized targeted counselling program. No longitudinal component was built into the site, ie, when patients logged on to the site a second time, no reference was made to their first “results.” If patients did not progress through the stages, they were presented with the same information package twice. Once they were presented with the information package for 1 stage of change, patients could browse to the packages for the other stages of change. The targeted information packages were designed to create or enforce a positive attitude towards decreasing fat consumption, to make people aware of the risks associated with increased fat intakes, and to provide patients with practical advice on how to decrease fat consumption. Canada's Food Guide to Healthy Eating (Minister of Supply and Services Canada 1992; catalog number H39-252/1992E) and existing Web-based and non-Web-based materials were used during the development of the Web-based targeted intervention packages that constituted Heartweb [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2"><offsets xml_i="17108" xml_f="17109" txt_i="10254" txt_f="10255">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17116" xml_f="17117" txt_i="10255" txt_f="10256">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5"><offsets xml_i="17150" xml_f="17151" txt_i="10256" txt_f="10257">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17158" xml_f="17159" txt_i="10257" txt_f="10258">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17"><offsets xml_i="17193" xml_f="17195" txt_i="10258" txt_f="10260">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17202" xml_f="17203" txt_i="10260" txt_f="10261">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30"><offsets xml_i="17237" xml_f="17239" txt_i="10261" txt_f="10263">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17246" xml_f="18366" txt_i="10263" txt_f="11383">].

They were also informed about the possibility to change and were encouraged to consider implementing dietary changes. Care was taken to avoid being patronizing. Common misconceptions about one's dietary behaviour could result in people classifying themselves in action or maintenance while not eating a sufficiently low-fat diet. This has consequences for the personalized feedback messages. In the action stage, people are usually encouraged to continue their efforts towards behaviour change (ie, further changes are often recommended). In the maintenance stage, by contrast, people are usually encouraged to maintain their current diet and no further changes are recommended.

In those studies, however, high exposure to the intervention was guaranteed by recruiting volunteers through email invitations and by installing the intervention program on a local hard disk. The low exposure to the intervention in our study was likely an important cause for the lack of effectiveness. Further, at baseline, participants had high levels of motivation and support and relatively good health compared with the non responders. Further, use of medication to control type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension was frequent. Because current practice guidelines recommend nutrition counselling before the prescription of medication, it is reasonable to assume that most participants already had a history of nutrition counselling. One may wonder how much effect any intervention might have on a highly treated population with relatively good health at baseline.

The absence of changes in social support may have been the result of high baseline support levels. Other possible explanations include the potentially limited effect of extending older people's social networks, a reluctance to ask or provide social support for partly self-inflicted conditions such as being overweight, the relative short duration of the intervention for a long-term stressor such as risk factors for cardiovascular disease, the lack of involvement by a general practitioner, or the use of a random group of peers rather than peers matched by personal characteristics such as age, sex, level of education, religious beliefs, and type of stressor [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43"><offsets xml_i="55808" xml_f="55810" txt_i="30773" txt_f="30775">43</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="55817" xml_f="55818" txt_i="30775" txt_f="30776">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45"><offsets xml_i="55852" xml_f="55854" txt_i="30776" txt_f="30778">45</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="55861" xml_f="56767" txt_i="30778" txt_f="31684">]. Another intermediate outcome, motivation to change, showed similarly minor effects. A median of 1 site visit may have been insufficient to produce significant improvements. Moreover, the high percentage of people who were already in the action and maintenance stages at baseline may have limited the possibility of finding improvements. It would be interesting to know whether there were any changes in the dietary fat intake of people in the intervention group who were in the maintenance stage at baseline. Their dietary fat intake at baseline was most likely higher than recommended as a result of common misconceptions. It is possible that participants who classified themselves in maintenance at baseline and did not eat a low-fat diet changed to in maintenance and began eating a low-fat diet as a result of the intervention.
