Since images are reformatted, streak artifacts that degrade bone visualization at direct coronal CT are projected over the crowns of the teeth, permitting optimal viewing of bone. As a result, these programs have been successfully used to evaluate implants, cysts, tumors, and surgical procedures.

Many osseous grafting materials have been used toward the goal of obtaining periodontal regeneration, for example, autografts, allografts, heterografts (or xenografts), and alloplastic materials.

In addition to processing variations, it has been demonstrated that young donor bone results in significantly greater quantities of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) retained in the bone allograft matrix compared with older donor bone. On the other hand, bovine bone grafts (BBGs) have long been used in the treatment of periodontal bone defects because of their potential for periodontal regeneration.[</offsets><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8327" xml_f="8328" txt_i="4047" txt_f="4048">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8335" xml_f="8336" txt_i="4048" txt_f="4049">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8343" xml_f="8575" txt_i="4050" txt_f="4282">Due to a paucity of literature on the role of Dentascan in periodontics, the purpose of the present study was to envisage the effectiveness of DFDBA and BBG for promoting defect fill in periodontal intrabony defects using Dentascan.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title><offsets xml_i="8638" xml_f="8659" txt_i="4284" txt_f="4305">MATERIALS AND METHODS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8670" xml_f="9023" txt_i="4306" txt_f="4659">A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Periodontology, faculty of dental sciences, K.

Although significant improvement was noted in bone fill and percentage gain with both the materials DFDBA (TG1) and BBG (TG2), there was no significant difference between the two. However, DFDBA was found to be superior to BBG. Further longitudinal studies with larger sample size and use of barrier membranes should be undertaken to substantiate the osteogenic potential of DFDBA and BBG.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title><offsets xml_i="26053" xml_f="26063" txt_i="17810" txt_f="17820">CONCLUSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26074" xml_f="26174" txt_i="17821" txt_f="17921">DFDBA is better treatment choice in compare to BBG for the management of two wall intrabony defects.</offsets></p><sec id="sec2-7"><title><offsets xml_i="26202" xml_f="26235" txt_i="17922" txt_f="17955">Financial support and sponsorship</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26246" xml_f="26250" txt_i="17956" txt_f="17960">Nil.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec2-8" sec-type="COI-statement"><title><offsets xml_i="26309" xml_f="26330" txt_i="17962" txt_f="17983">Conflicts of interest</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26341" xml_f="26376" txt_i="17984" txt_f="18019">There are no conflicts of interest.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abrahams</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dental CT imaging: A look at the jaw</article-title><source>Radiology</source><year>2001</year><volume>219</volume><fpage>334</fpage><lpage>45</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11323454</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Rothman</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhodes</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Chafetz</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Computed tomography: Part I.
