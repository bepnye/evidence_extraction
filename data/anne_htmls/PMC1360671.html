H2-receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been extensively used in the treatment of peptic ulcers. Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, prevents rebleeding by increasing gastric pH and stabilizing blood clots in the base of the ulcer. Nevertheless, in several studies, H2-receptor blockers were not found to have any strict and persistent effect on gastrointestinal bleeding and did not decrease the rates of rebleeding, surgical interventions or mortality [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="7540" xml_f="7541" txt_i="3564" txt_f="3565">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7548" xml_f="7549" txt_i="3565" txt_f="3566">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><offsets xml_i="7581" xml_f="7583" txt_i="3566" txt_f="3568">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7590" xml_f="7591" txt_i="3568" txt_f="3569">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="7623" xml_f="7625" txt_i="3569" txt_f="3571">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7632" xml_f="7634" txt_i="3571" txt_f="3573">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7641" xml_f="8072" txt_i="3574" txt_f="4005">The role of treatment with proton pump inhibitors in the patients with active or recent ulcer bleeding is controversial. If given in an adequate dose by continuous intravenous infusion, proton pump inhibitors can maintain intragastric pH at 6 or above. At such levels of pH, peptic activity is minimized, platelet function is optimized, and fibrinolysis is inhibited; these effects may help to stabilize clot formation in an ulcer.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8079" xml_f="8492" txt_i="4006" txt_f="4419">In case intravenous treatment is unavailable or particularly expensive, oral treatment would be appropriate.
