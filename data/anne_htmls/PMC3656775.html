Although screening with fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) or endoscopy has been shown to decrease CRC mortality, screening rates remain suboptimal. Screening rates are particularly low for people with low incomes and members of underrepresented minority groups. FOBT should be done annually to detect CRC early and to reduce CRC mortality, but this often does not occur. This paper describes the design of a multifaceted intervention to increase long-term adherence to FOBT among poor, predominantly Latino patients, and the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of this intervention compared to usual care.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6206" xml_f="6213" txt_i="744" txt_f="751">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6224" xml_f="7014" txt_i="752" txt_f="1542">In this RCT, patients who are due for repeat FOBT are identified in the electronic health record (EHR) and randomized to receive either usual care or a multifaceted intervention. The usual care group includes multiple point-of-care interventions (e.g., standing orders, EHR reminders), performance measurement, and financial incentives to improve CRC screening rates. The intervention augments usual care through mailed CRC screening test kits, low literacy patient education materials, automated phone and text message reminders, in-person follow up calls from a CRC Screening Coordinator, and communication of results to patients along with a reminder card highlighting when the patient is next due for screening. The primary outcome is completion of FOBT within 6 months of becoming due.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7036" xml_f="7046" txt_i="1544" txt_f="1554">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7057" xml_f="7751" txt_i="1555" txt_f="2249">The main goal of the study is to determine the comparative effectiveness of the intervention compared to usual care. Additionally, we want to assess whether or not it is possible to achieve high rates of adherence to CRC screening with annual FOBT, which is necessary for reducing CRC mortality. The intervention relies on technology that is increasingly widespread and declining in cost, including EHR systems, automated phone and text messaging, and FOBTs for CRC screening. We took this approach to ensure generalizability and allow us to rapidly disseminate the intervention through networks of community health centers (CHCs) if the RCT shows the intervention to be superior to usual care.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7773" xml_f="7791" txt_i="2251" txt_f="2269">Trial registration</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7802" xml_f="7821" txt_i="2270" txt_f="2289">ClinicalTrials.gov </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/NCT01453894"><offsets xml_i="7906" xml_f="7917" txt_i="2289" txt_f="2300">NCT01453894</offsets></ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7990" xml_f="8000" txt_i="2309" txt_f="2319">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8011" xml_f="8242" txt_i="2320" txt_f="2551">The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends colorectal cancer (CRC) screening using fecal occult blood test (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 and continuing until age 75 [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="8273" xml_f="8274" txt_i="2551" txt_f="2552">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8281" xml_f="8335" txt_i="2552" txt_f="2606">].

However, FOBT should be done every 1–2 years to optimize detection of polyps and early cancer. Performing the test less often may result in many aggressive cancers being missed until an advanced stage, markedly reducing the health benefits of population screening. Individuals in vulnerable groups often face multiple barriers to annual FOBT screening, including lack of regular source of care, less frequent routine medical visits, frequent changes in residence, and lack of awareness of the need for annual FOBT screening. If FOBT cannot be conducted annually or biennially with high reliability, it may be necessary to expand the use of alternative screening modalities, such as endoscopy (i.e., sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy), to reduce CRC mortality. However, there is currently inadequate financing and an inadequate number of endoscopists available for CHCs to use endoscopy as a primary screening modality.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9832" xml_f="9902" txt_i="3861" txt_f="3931">Few studies have examined the rate of repeat CRC screening with FOBT [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="9934" xml_f="9936" txt_i="3931" txt_f="3933">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9943" xml_f="9944" txt_i="3933" txt_f="3934">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="9976" xml_f="9978" txt_i="3934" txt_f="3936">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9985" xml_f="10403" txt_i="3936" txt_f="4354">]. To our knowledge, none have been conducted in populations with high prevalence of barriers to screening (e.g., low literacy, varied cultural norms, transportation difficulties).

Therefore, studies are needed to develop and test strategies to increase adherence to FOBT over multiple years. It is important to evaluate a) whether these strategies improve adherence compared to high-quality usual care, and b) whether multifaceted interventions can achieve the consistently high adherence rates year after year that are required to reduce late-stage CRC and CRC mortality.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10846" xml_f="12060" txt_i="4752" txt_f="5966">This paper describes the design of a comparative effectiveness study of an intervention to maximize the number of poor, predominantly Latino patients cared for at a CHC who complete a repeat FOBT within six months of becoming due for CRC screening.

We then review critical aspects of the study design and intervention, including a) the use of an IRB-approved waiver of informed consent to randomize all eligible patients and achieve a fully representative study population, b) the conceptual framework for the multifaceted intervention, c) the outreach tools developed for each component of the intervention, d) separation of the intervention into two discrete phases to allow assessment of the marginal benefit of outreach by a CRC Screening Coordinator compared to lower-cost outreach strategies, e) the patient educational tools developed to provide feedback to patients with negative FOBTs and to improve successful completion of diagnostic colonoscopy among patients with positive FOBTs, and f) the outcome assessment.

This rate had been stable over the previous six months and was similar to many other CHCs in Chicago. Between December, 2007 and October, 2009, EFHC implemented several system-level changes designed to improve CRC screening rates. These efforts are best viewed as a single quality improvement initiative with multiple components: a) performance measurement, feedback, and financial incentives, b) implementation of a team-based care approach empowering medical assistants (MAs) to recommend CRC screening, and c) development of strategies to improve access to diagnostic colonoscopy.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="13496" xml_f="13555" txt_i="7356" txt_f="7415">Performance measurement, feedback, and financial incentives</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="13566" xml_f="14492" txt_i="7416" txt_f="8342">EFHC uses performance measures to determine provider incentive payments. These measures are chosen every year by the providers themselves to reflect their priorities, rather than being imposed by EFHC’s management team. In 2007, providers chose CRC screening as a performance measure. As a result, adult medicine providers were routinely told what percent of their patient panel was up to date on CRC screening. Along with their individual performance, providers are also shown how their screening rates rank among other adult providers within the organization. Performance on the CRC measure was also used to allocate performance-based incentive bonuses. Each quarter, providers receive a bonus for falling in the top and middle terciles of similar providers in each measure. Along with their individual performance, providers are also shown how their screening rates rank among other adult providers within the organization.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="14514" xml_f="14581" txt_i="8344" txt_f="8411">Empowerment of medical assistants to offer CRC screening if overdue</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="14592" xml_f="15281" txt_i="8412" txt_f="9101">EFHC also implemented a standing order that allowed MAs to recommend guaiac card FOBT screening during pre-appointment triage and vital signs measurement to patients who were age 50 or older and not up to date on CRC screening. If the patients agreed to take the FOBT cards home, the MA showed them how to use it and answered basic questions about the test. If patients had questions beyond the MA’s scope of practice, patients were told to discuss this during the provider visit. The provider also had a chance to reinforce the MA’s recommendation to perform the test or to attempt to change a patient’s decision if the patient did not agree to the screening when the MA offered the test.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="15303" xml_f="15344" txt_i="9103" txt_f="9144">Improved access to diagnostic colonoscopy</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="15355" xml_f="16122" txt_i="9145" txt_f="9912">Before August, 2009, uninsured EFHC patients had access to diagnostic colonoscopies only through self-pay, charity programs, or care at public hospitals. Each of those modes has limitations. Most uninsured EFHC patients would find the cost of self-financing a colonoscopy not feasible. Charity care applications’ bureaucratic and documentation requirements can be challenging for all patients, especially those with low literacy. Furthermore, public hospitals in the Chicago area tend to have long waitlists for services, especially procedural tests like colonoscopy. These challenges may have caused some providers to be unwilling to use FOBT for CRC screening if they believed a patient could not get a timely diagnostic colonoscopy if the FOBT result was positive.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16129" xml_f="17155" txt_i="9913" txt_f="10939">In August, 2009, EFHC and Northwestern Memorial Hospital implemented an agreement to provide free diagnostic colonoscopies to uninsured patients who met EFHC’s sliding scale fee criteria. Further eligibility requirements included that the patient not be insulin-dependent, be older than age 50 (or 40 if they have a first-degree relative who had colorectal cancer), and have some indicator for being high risk (i.e., have a positive FOBT, first degree family member, history of rectal bleeding, or tubular adenoma on prior colonoscopy). More than just making colonoscopies affordable, the program eased access by allowing EFHC to directly schedule patients into dedicated appointment slots, thereby reducing the scheduling complexity for the patient. Further, pre-procedure preparation instructions and materials were given at EFHC to reduce literacy barriers and increase compliance. Patients for whom transportation was a barrier were given the option of being chaperoned to and from the appointment by an EFHC staff member.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17177" xml_f="17211" txt_i="10941" txt_f="10975">Improvements in CRC screening rate</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17222" xml_f="17655" txt_i="10976" txt_f="11409">By October, 2009, the screening rate at EFHC had more than doubled to 43%.

This study was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board (IRB). It was approved with a waiver of patient informed consent for randomization because it met previously established criteria: 1) very low risk to patients, as is typically the case for interventions designed to improve adherence to national guidelines, 2) informed consent could not be obtained without seriously threatening the validity of the study (i.e., if we attempted to obtain informed consent, patients in the usual care arm would be made aware of their need for repeat CRC screening), and 3) all patient information (e.g., demographic, diagnoses) and outcomes were obtained using data collected during the routine course of their care by querying the EHR database.

The outcome is assessed by querying the EHR for both intervention and usual care patients to determine if a FOBT screening test was completed. By relying only on the EHR for outcome assessment for both the intervention and usual care group, we hope to avoid any bias that might occur in the rates of detection of FOBT completion. Specifically, if the CRC Screening Coordinator was aware that a FIT was performed but the results were not documented in the EHR, the patient would still be classified as having not completed screening. Using only EHR data for outcome assessment is conceptually similar to blinded outcome assessment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37329" xml_f="37845" txt_i="26826" txt_f="27342">We have found that some patients randomized to the intervention have a repeat FOBT done at a clinical encounter shortly before the date that they are due for the intervention.

We assumed that 35% of patients in the usual care group will achieve the primary outcome, similar to the rate in previously published studies. To detect a 10% difference (45% vs. 35%) with 80% power (2-tailed alpha = .05), we would need 752 patients (376 in each arm). This is less than the 800 patients that we estimated will be eligible for the study.

It is important to stress that “usual care” at EFHC is at a high standard, consisting of team-based care for promoting CRC screening, point-of-care alerts for clinicians, and performance measurement and feedback to providers. These efforts to improve CRC screening are probably far greater than those in most private practices and CHCs. Health services research studies sometimes have relatively weak “usual care” groups; although the care for the control group may be “typical” care, it is not consistent with what the literature has shown to be evidence-based best practice. Thus, it can be hard to determine whether a new intervention truly has a marginal value beyond what has already been shown to be beneficial. In contrast, the usual care group in this study includes multiple evidence-based strategies to improve preventive service delivery through point-of-care quality improvement methods.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41129" xml_f="41872" txt_i="30497" txt_f="31240">This study will examine use of an EHR system for population-based disease management and outreach among vulnerable patients cared for in CHCs. Very few studies have examined the benefit of using EHR-based interventions in this setting. These data are important, as more CHCs are seeking to become patient-centered medical homes with good health information technology (HIT) infrastructure. In addition, our study design will allow us to separate the effects of low cost technology (automated reminders) followed by more costly efforts (telephone outreach by a CRC Screening Coordinator). This tiered outreach strategy could help clinics maximize efficiency and make decisions as to when it is helpful to use more resource intensive strategies.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41879" xml_f="42246" txt_i="31241" txt_f="31608">Although the main goal of this study is to determine the comparative effectiveness of the intervention compared to usual care, we also want to see if it is possible to achieve the high rates of adherence to CRC screening with annual FOBT that are necessary to achieve measurable reductions in CRC mortality.
