A three level model was developed using the HML Software Version 6.08 (Scientific Software International, Lincolnwood, IL, USA). Level 1 variables were the repeated measurements within individuals by group and time (baseline and 1-year), individual (level 2) variables were age in years and gender and practice (level 3) variables were as described above. Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, with last available measure carried forward where data were missing at follow-up.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19809" xml_f="19953" txt_i="14056" txt_f="14200">Cardiovascular risk (log transformed) was modelled using a multi-level linear regression equation including variables with the following coding:</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19969" xml_f="19991" txt_i="14201" txt_f="14223">Practice level factors</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20002" xml_f="20066" txt_i="14224" txt_f="14288">• Socio-economic status, IMDG – 1 More deprived, 2 More affluent</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20073" xml_f="20189" txt_i="14289" txt_f="14405">• Staggered recruitment group, SRG – 1 Recruited in first group of practices… 5 Recruited in last group of practices</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20196" xml_f="20300" txt_i="14406" txt_f="14504">• Practice size, PRACSIZE – 1 Small (&lt;3500 patients), 2 Medium (≥3500 and &lt; 7000), 3 Large (≥7000)</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20322" xml_f="20346" txt_i="14506" txt_f="14530">Individual level factors</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20357" xml_f="20375" txt_i="14531" txt_f="14549">• Age (years), AGE</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20382" xml_f="20414" txt_i="14550" txt_f="14582">• Gender, SEX – 0 Male, 1 Female</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20436" xml_f="20467" txt_i="14584" txt_f="14615">Identifier variables related to</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20478" xml_f="20572" txt_i="14616" txt_f="14710">• Group, GROUP – 0 NHS Health Check only, 1 NHS Health Check plus additional lifestyle support</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20579" xml_f="20628" txt_i="14711" txt_f="14760">• Time, TIME – 0 Baseline, 1 Follow-up at 1 year.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20635" xml_f="20681" txt_i="14761" txt_f="14807">The model also included variance components, r</offsets><sub><offsets xml_i="20686" xml_f="20687" txt_i="14807" txt_f="14808">0</offsets></sub><offsets xml_i="20693" xml_f="20784" txt_i="14808" txt_f="14899"> representing variation associated with differences between individuals within practices, u</offsets><sub><offsets xml_i="20789" xml_f="20791" txt_i="14899" txt_f="14901">00</offsets></sub><offsets xml_i="20797" xml_f="20913" txt_i="14901" txt_f="15017"> representing variation associated with differences between practices and e representing random (measurement) error.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20920" xml_f="20925" txt_i="15018" txt_f="15023">The χ</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="20930" xml_f="20931" txt_i="15023" txt_f="15024">2</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="20937" xml_f="21318" txt_i="15024" txt_f="15405"> test was used to assess differences in categorical variables between groups.

Eligible participants (n=601) were randomised into two groups, the NHS Health Check only group (n=365) and the NHS Health Check plus additional lifestyle support group (n=236). Baseline data were obtained for all participants, apart from 15 waist circumference and 6 pulse rate measurements. At follow-up, 70 (19%) participants from the NHS Health Check only group and 45 (19%) participants from the NHS Health Check plus additional lifestyle support group had missing CVD risk scores (primary outcome). Since the primary analysis was to be carried out on an ITT basis, missing values were replaced by carrying forward the last available measurement.

At the practice level, only socio-economic status made a marginally significant contribution to explaining the variation in CVD risk, with more affluent practices having a tendency towards lower risk scores. As expected, older age and male gender were associated with increased CVD risk. There was no significant difference in CVD risk between comparator groups, whereas CVD risk at the 1-year follow-up was significantly lower than at baseline. On this basis, overall population mean CVD risk was reduced from 31.1% to 27.8%, a reduction of 10.5% of the baseline score, after adjusting for all other factors in the model.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label><offsets xml_i="39036" xml_f="39043" txt_i="21464" txt_f="21471">Table 3</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="39063"

At the 1-year follow-up, there was significant reduction in the number of patients who had high blood pressure, high cholesterol and who were smokers. Obesity was not significantly changed but there was some evidence of beneficial population change, where central obesity was reduced in patients in the additional lifestyle support group and overall. There was further evidence of beneficial lifestyle change through improved diet and physical activity scores in both treatment groups (Wilcoxon test on ordered categories, p &lt; 0.001). Mean diet score increased from 2.1 to 2.4 (NHS Health Check only group) and from 2.2 to 2.45 (NHS Health Check plus additional lifestyle support); mean physical activity score increased from 2.65 to 2.8 (NHS Health Check only group) and from 2.67 to 2.81 (NHS Health Check plus additional lifestyle support).</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T5"><label><offsets xml_i="52010"

in CVD risk and in established CVD risk factor profiles over the 1-year intervention period. These beneficial changes were similar in the two groups. Thus, there was no added value of additional lifestyle support, at least, in terms of absolute cardiovascular risk and individual CVD risk factor reduction. In principle, these findings support the effectiveness of the NHS Health Check programme delivered through general practice. However, as shown in Figure

We should bear in mind that this research was carried out during the early stages of the national roll-out of new policy. For many practices, this was the first opportunity they had had to have access to a full electronic search of the practice database and a complete list of current ‘high CVD risk’ patients to manage proactively. Although additional funding was made available through a Locally Enhanced Service agreement, there will undoubtedly have been a step change in internal demand within each practice and in external demand in the supporting community. Alternative modes of recruitment of patients may offer some potential for increased efficiency and reduction of costs. Some of these, for example bespoke drop-in clinics, opportunistic health checks or partial health checks, have been piloted in the overall programme of research in Stoke on Trent, of which this study is a part

Coupled with general practice readiness, it is also true that the type of client represented by a high CVD risk patient may be quite different from the usual users of community services.

Our data on referral to the lifestyle coaches and the personal health plan goals set by participants (not reported here) indicated that referral to the lifestyle coach was good and valued by participants.

Overall, data quality was adequate though most practice lists contained ‘ghost’ data and missing or non-usable items, requiring varying degrees of screening and cleaning before use. Approximately 8% of those on the lists drawn from practice records could not be re-contacted for administrative reasons, where either key data were missing or records were not updated, for example, for patients who had moved away from the area or who had died. A further approximately 29% of patients did not respond to the invitation to attend a health check (with a minimum of two follow-up invitations). This represents an area of uncertainty in that we have no way of knowing whether these patients were simply not interested in a health check and chose not to respond or whether the invitations were never received. Thus, about two thirds of those patients on lists compiled from practice databases were accessible and, potentially, could benefit from the NHS Health Check service. The error or uncertainty in the remaining one third of patients may imply an additional administrative burden for practices to routinely assure data entry, to check data for completeness and to archive redundant data.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="64248" xml_f="64841" txt_i="31727" txt_f="32320">Data entry would also benefit from greater standardisation and more robust supporting software (with in-built data checking where feasible). Free text entry, for example, was very cumbersome to analyse for many of the fields, including primary risk fields e.g. smoking status, used in this research and consumed a significant amount of resource simply to recode already entered data. Notwithstanding the loss of efficiency, this process is error prone and, bearing in mind that a single missing datum could mean that a significant diagnosis or treatment could be missed, would be best avoided.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="64863" xml_f="64874" txt_i="32322" txt_f="32333">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="64885" xml_f="65539" txt_i="32334" txt_f="32988">The national policy directive and launch of the NHS Health Check service overtook our original cluster randomised controlled trial design (which had been piloted and planned in the two years preceding the national programme launch). In effect, the NHS Health Check service became the standard treatment for the population of interest in our trial. Thus, instead of being a randomised controlled trial it became a randomised comparison of two treatments, both of which were relatively new developments. This meant that we did not have a control group against which to compare our two treatments. This limits our ability to attribute effects to treatments.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="65546" xml_f="65965" txt_i="32989" txt_f="33408">In addition, uptake was lower than anticipated, even taking into consideration that the NHS Health Check service was being implemented simultaneously across the whole of general practice in Stoke on Trent. Thus, recruitment to the trial was much less than target (35 versus 46 practices target; 601 versus 1840 patients target).

The Framingham 10-year CVD risk calculator, albeit the recommended approach at the time our research was carried out, includes just three modifiable risk factors: blood pressure, cholesterol levels and smoking. It is possible that this measure may lack the sensitivity to detect more subtle effects of lifestyle changes such as increased physical activity, better diet and weight loss that may take a longer time to manifest than the one year of follow-up considered here. This may explain, in part, our inability to detect an effect of the additional lifestyle support after one year.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="66659" xml_f="66967" txt_i="34090" txt_f="34398">About 20% of data were missing at follow-up.

Thus, we were unable to differentiate independent effects of individual treatments.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="67872" xml_f="68992" txt_i="35213" txt_f="36333">Finally, there was an inadvertent imbalance in the number of participants in the two arms of the trial. This came about because a number of patients withdrew from the study after having given their written informed consent but before they had left the clinic after their final baseline health check visit. This was an unforeseen circumstance and presented us with an ethical dilemma – patient choice or research rigour. We took the pragmatic decision that we could not go against the patient’s choice and so these patients were treated as if they had declined to participate in the research. There were no apparent differences in demographic and key clinical measures between our two groups but we have no way of knowing whether other important biases may have been introduced by this means. Certainly, there does seem to be a bias in treatment preference since the choice to opt out in this way was higher for those allocated initially to the additional lifestyle support group. This observation adds weight to our earlier point about there being a need to consider population readiness for lifestyle change more fully.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="69043" xml_f="69054" txt_i="36336" txt_f="36347">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="69065" xml_f="69712" txt_i="36348" txt_f="36995">Introduction of the NHS Health Check service in Stoke on Trent led to significant reductions in estimated population cardiovascular disease risk and associated individual risk factors.
