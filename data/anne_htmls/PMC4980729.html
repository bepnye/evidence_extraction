The effect of pranlukast on congestion in pollinosis as shown in this study, suggests that pranlukast inhibits LTs produced by mast cells or eosinophils in the immediate phase, and LTs produced by eosinophils in the late phase.

Furthermore, continuous treatment with pranlukast on the night after exposure and on the following morning significantly inhibited nasal symptoms, including congestion at night on the exposure day until noon on the following day. This suggests that treatment with pranlukast before cedar pollen season may inhibit symptoms, in other words demonstrate efficacy by preventive administration.
