To locate the incision site, a transverse line was drawn at the proximal wrist crease. Second line was drawn between the midpoint of the wrist line (between the scaphoid and hamate bones) and the radial side of the ring finger. Finally the third line was designated transversally along the ulnar side of fully abducted thumb. A 1 to 1.5 cm incision was made along the second line proximal to the intersection with the third line. The incision site has less subcutaneous fat tissue compared with the open surgery. Using the Freer elevator to approach proximally under the fat and along with the ulnar edge of palmaris longus tendon, it reaches space between interthenar fascia and flexor retinaculum. A 3 to 4 mm incision was made at the distal edge of flexor retinaculum close to the ulnar side and then the Knifelight was turned on and operation room was darkened as much as possible. The Knifelight was inserted through the incision as the longer tip was under flexor retinaculum and short tip placed over it in the space between interthenar fascia and flexor retinaculum. At this time, only the light spot of the short tip was visible clearly through the skin. The desired site was determined with the light source and median nerve was released from the carpal tunnel compression. The device was pushed gently to the proximal until the blade was cut the flexor retinaculum. Then it was pulled back slightly to overview the cutting. This process was repeated until the retinaculum was released completely. In this stage, light spots at both tips of the device were visible through the skin. The Knifelight was taken out and the tourniquet was unfastened to evaluate hemostasis. The palmar fascia was stitched with absorbable suture and skin was closed with 2.0 or 3.0 nylon suture. Finally a pressure dressing was applied in place. The patients were encouraged to start daily activities after a week and sutures were removed after 10 to 14 days (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4180R10"><offsets xml_i="12388" xml_f="12390" txt_i="7144" txt_f="7146">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12397" xml_f="12398" txt_i="7146" txt_f="7147">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4180R12"><offsets xml_i="12435" xml_f="12437" txt_i="7147" txt_f="7149">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="12444" xml_f="12446" txt_i="7149" txt_f="7151">).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec15599"><title><offsets xml_i="12482" xml_f="12507" txt_i="7153" txt_f="7178">3.2.

</p><p>A variety of surgical treatment methods for carpal tunnel syndrome are introduced recently, including open surgery, endoscopic and the Knifelight. According to the results of this study, Knifelight as a novel method of surgery could decrease scar tenderness and time before return to daily activities for patients and is accompanied with less disturbance to fine sensory nerves.</p></fn><fn id="afn10270" fn-type="other"><p>
