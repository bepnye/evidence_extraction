The study population comprised of 51 male and 31 female patients in the age range of 17 - 49 years. Patients were divided into two groups randomly, according to stent usage. The UPJO diagnosis was made on the basis of patient reported symptoms, sonographic findings and intravenous pyelography (IVP) and diethylene-triamine-pentaacetate (DTPA) scan results. Those cases with renal failure, history of previous UPJO repair or requiring emergent drainage because of renal stone or infection were all excluded. Surgical intervention was performed through a flank incision via an intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal approach. Classic standard dismembered pyeloplasty was performed. After completion of the posterior suture line, a DJ catheter was paced in the internal drainage group (randomly selected) while in other stentless cases, a temporary feeding tube was inserted for secure anastomosis, which was later removed. Anastomosis was performed using 4-0 chromic separate sutures in a water tight fashion. Pyeloplasty was performed by continuous interlock sutures where needed. A drain was also placed in the retroperitoneal space and fallow-up of patients was planned weekly. Drain output was assessed and it was extracted when drainage became less than 50 cc per day. All cases were also assessed for fever and urinary tract infection symptoms. Urine analysis was done and oral antibiotics were continued for at least 5 days after discharge. The IVP was performed after 4 weeks in all patients and the renal function and probable extravasation and structural anomalies were evaluated. Those patients with internal stent were admitted again after 1 month to remove the stent if no complication had occurred. A 3 day course of oral antibiotic therapy was also started at the time of stent removal. Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS software Ver. 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) using T standard and Chi-Square tests. A P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec92058"><title><offsets xml_i="9067" xml_f="9077" txt_i="5093" txt_f="5103">4.

Among patients with extravasation in DTPA scan in the stent free group, retrograde DJ stent was inserted in four cases that had unacceptable drainage due to inflammation. One patient had distal ureter obstruction because of distal ureter stone, that was treated by Trans-ureteral lithotripsy (TULP) and stent support. Three other cases had no anatomical abnormality, and they were followed and extravasation resolved spontaneously at control IVP after one month. Removal of DJ stent was planned in one month after operation. However, eight cases missed the time and late stent removal was accompanied with several complications, such as stone formation on the tip of catheter in the bladder of a patient that needed TULP before stent removal.</offsets></p><table-wrap id="tbl23577" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="10845" xml_f="10853" txt_i="6661" txt_f="6669">Table 1.</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="10877" xml_f="10957" txt_i="6669" txt_f="6749"> Results of Preoperative Ultrasonography and Intravenous Pyelography Evaluation </offsets><sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="fn21576"><offsets xml_i="11002" xml_f="11003" txt_i="6749" txt_f="6750">a</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11010" xml_f="11012" txt_i="6750" txt_f="6752">, </offsets><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="fn21577"><offsets xml_i="11052" xml_f="11053" txt_i="6752" txt_f="6753">b</offsets></xref></sup></title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th style="text-align: left;" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="11186" xml_f="11200" txt_i="6754" txt_f="6768">Imaging Method</offsets></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="11233" xml_f="11245" txt_i="6768" txt_f="6780">Right Kidney</offsets></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="11278" xml_f="11289" txt_i="6780" txt_f="6791">Left Kidney</offsets></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="11346" xml_f="11347" txt_i="6791" txt_f="6792">

Recently, and especially by promotion of minimally invasive methods and laparoscopic repair of UPJO, an ongoing debate is seen regarding the pros and cons of internal drainage in UPJO repair. Stents associated symptoms, such as dysuria, frequency, flank pain, hematuria, are commonly reported, even with short term placemat of urethral catheters, that may be so severe in selected cases that they even interfere with daily activities and impair the quality of life (</offsets><xref rid="A21800R8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="21443" xml_f="21444" txt_i="9527" txt_f="9528">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21451" xml_f="21547" txt_i="9528" txt_f="9624">). Joshi et al. reported these bothering urinary complains in 78% of cases with ureteral stent (</offsets><xref rid="A21800R9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="21584" xml_f="21585" txt_i="9624" txt_f="9625">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21592" xml_f="21723" txt_i="9625" txt_f="9756">).

Potential catheter related complications include catheter dislocation or migration that may cause stent dysfunction and even obstructive uropathy, retained fragments, stone formation on the foreign body, exposure of upper system to high pressure during voiding and an artificial reflux uropathy, flank pain and an increased rate of catheter related urinary infections (</offsets><xref rid="A21800R7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="22177" xml_f="22178" txt_i="10129" txt_f="10130">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22185" xml_f="22187" txt_i="10130" txt_f="10132">, </offsets><xref rid="A21800R10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="22225" xml_f="22227" txt_i="10132" txt_f="10134">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22234" xml_f="22236" txt_i="10134" txt_f="10136">, </offsets><xref rid="A21800R11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="22274" xml_f="22276" txt_i="10136" txt_f="10138">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22283" xml_f="22506" txt_i="10138" txt_f="10361">). The need for readmission and general anesthesia occurs, especially in children. Several attempts have been done to prevent readmission and repeated general anesthesia for catheter removal, and unfortunately they failed (</offsets><xref rid="A21800R12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="22544" xml_f="22546" txt_i="10361" txt_f="10363">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22553" xml_f="22555" txt_i="10363" txt_f="10365">, </offsets><xref rid="A21800R13" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="22593" xml_f="22595" txt_i="10365" txt_f="10367">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22602" xml_f="23066" txt_i="10367" txt_f="10831">). In our study comparing two techniques of pyeloplasty with or without internal drainage, there was no significant difference between groups, concerning extravasation and anastomosis complications, such as leakage, stenosis, urinoma formation, evidence of obstruction at postoperative IVP or DTPA scan. However, a significant incidence of catheter related symptoms, such as irritative urinary symptoms and flank pain was reported. Similar studies, such as Kumar (</offsets><xref rid="A21800R8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="23103" xml_f="23104" txt_i="10831" txt_f="10832">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23111" xml_f="23131" txt_i="10832" txt_f="10852">) or Nguyen et al.
