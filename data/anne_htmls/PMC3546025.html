Based on eligibility, volunteers were randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) 7% weight loss with EAAMR, or 7% weight loss using CMR. Both groups consumed 5 servings of a meal replacement (170 kcal x 5 servings/day) and ~400 kcal/day of solid food that yielded ~1250 kcal/day. Regardless of group assignment, the total kcal/week remained constant throughout the intervention to ensure a high level of compliance and allow for consistent, reliable reductions in the amount of weight lost. Obese, elderly volunteers in both groups (EAAMR or CMR) completed one visits that included a stable isotope experimental session described below. Following the completion of the experimental testing sessions, all volunteers were instructed to consume a low calorie diet for 8 weeks. During this weight loss intervention, volunteers consumed ~1250 kcal/day consisting of solid food and liquid supplements. Although the time course of the caloric restriction phase may seem somewhat overbearing from a logistical standpoint, the difficulty entailed was dramatically reduced through the use of pre-packaged meal replacements either in the form of EAAMR or CMR that required no preparation. In addition, we suggested solid food products preferred by clients in the UAMS weight loss clinic that achieve optimal compliance and consistently provide predictable weight loss. Body weight and body composition was measured weekly by our clinical staff. Any volunteer that failed to lose weight on two subsequent visits was removed from the study for noncompliance to the protocol.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12617" xml_f="13223" txt_i="8115" txt_f="8721">Experimental Paradigm.

This remains an important issue. Acute administration of EAAMR did promote a significant increase in skeletal muscle protein FSR compared to CMR. Assuming that the energy cost of protein synthesis is 3.6 kJ/g and the baseline GAIA-derived lean tissue mass was 56.4 kg for EAAMR and 54.4 kg for the CMR, we can extrapolate that the overall energy discrepancy between the two groups was roughly equivalent to 27,170 kcal or 3.5 kg of weight loss across the entire caloric restriction-based weight loss paradigm. Based on the amount of total lean mass in each group, this value takes into account a consistent intervention structure of five servings/day across an eight week period.

While the results of the present study do not suggest that EAAMR would be sufficient to completely prevent the reduction of lean tissue during caloric restriction-induced weight loss, we were able to demonstrate the preferential reduction of adipose tissue with 7% weight loss. Moreover, the acute anabolic response to the ingestion of EAAMR was directly linked to increased diet-induced caloric expenditure that may have responsible for the increased loss of adipose tissue. Due to results of the current investigation, we anticipate that improvements in insulin sensitivity derived from the preferential loss of adipose tissue will maximize the anabolic efficiency to nutrition. Based on earlier studies where we have examined the influence of EAA on muscle protein synthesis [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="36493" xml_f="36495" txt_i="23689" txt_f="23691">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36502" xml_f="37063" txt_i="23691" txt_f="24252">], a two-sample t-test would have 80% power to detect effect sizes as small as 0.566 in 35 volunteers. It is also important to mention that the individuals in the current study were still deficient in terms of the their total protein intake in the context of caloric restriction, and we are currently revising our formulation to address this issue. In conclusion, we propose that high quality protein + essential amino acids represent a critical variable in the preservation of lean tissue and augmentation of adipose tissue reduction in the elderly population.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37085" xml_f="37098" txt_i="24254" txt_f="24267">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37109" xml_f="37321" txt_i="24268" txt_f="24480">EAAMR: Essential amino acid meal replacement; CMR: Competitive meal replacement; RDA: Recommended daily allowance; FSR: Fractional synthetic rate; GCMS: Gas chromatography/Mass spectrometry; BMI: Body mass index.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37343" xml_f="37362" txt_i="24482" txt_f="24501">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37373" xml_f="37432" txt_i="24502" txt_f="24561">The authors’ declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="37454" xml_f="37476" txt_i="24563" txt_f="24585">Authors’ contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="37487" xml_f="37951" txt_i="24586" txt_f="25050">RHC conceived the study, and participated in its design and coordination, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the original manuscript.
