thoracic manipulation for patients with chronic neck pain and then investigate the changes
of cervical proprioception and pain. [Subjects and Methods] Subjects were 30 workers with
mechanical neck pain, who were randomly divided into an upper thoracic manipulation group
and a cervical stability training group. Upper thoracic manipulation after cervical
stability training was conducted for the upper thoracic manipulation group, and only
stability training was conducted for the cervical stability training group. The
intervention period was six weeks, and consisted of three sessions a week, each of which
lasted for 30 minutes. For proprioception measurement, an electro-goniometer was used to
measure reposition sense before and after the intervention. The visual analogue scale was
used to assess pain. [Results] After the intervention, the error angle was significantly
smaller in flexion and right left side-bending, and pain was significantly reduced in the
upper thoracic manipulation group. According to the post intervention comparison of the
two groups, there were significant differences in the proprioception and pain values.
[Conclusion] Conducting both cervical stability training and upper thoracic manipulation
for patients with chronic neck pain was more helpful for the improvement of proprioception
and pain than cervical stability training alone.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Neck pain</kwd><kwd>Manipulation</kwd><kwd>Proprioception</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="4801" xml_f="4813" txt_i="1477" txt_f="1489">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4824" xml_f="5107" txt_i="1490" txt_f="1773">Neck pain is a disease that most people experience at least once in their life time.

repositioning test was conducted to measure the propriocetive deficit. However, this is an
