A majority of 56% (combined percentages of statements 1 [n=18], 2 [n=11], and 3 [n=16]) of the patients believed in the benefit of receiving PCC, and all agreed that men should be involved in PCC as well.

In the Netherlands, PCC is only delivered to a select group of women, mainly those who have a fertility problem or a high risk for adverse pregnancy outcome due to a known genetic or medical condition or a previous poor pregnancy outcome. However, at their own request, couples can receive PCC from a health care professional, but so far only a very small proportion of the general population takes advantage of this. The low uptake of PCC, combined with the high prevalence of unhealthy nutrition and lifestyle behaviors, illustrates the lack of awareness regarding the importance of PCC in couples who are trying to conceive [</offsets><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9819" xml_f="9820" txt_i="3760" txt_f="3761">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9827" xml_f="9828" txt_i="3761" txt_f="3762">-</offsets><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9861" xml_f="9862" txt_i="3762" txt_f="3763">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9869" xml_f="9871" txt_i="3763" txt_f="3765">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9878" xml_f="10146" txt_i="3766" txt_f="4034">Currently, rapid developments in the field of telemedicine by means of electronic health (eHealth) and mobile health (mHealth) are opening doors to new opportunities to empower patients and health care providers and professionals and to fill the gaps in patient care [</offsets><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10179" xml_f="10180" txt_i="4034" txt_f="4035">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10187" xml_f="10188" txt_i="4035" txt_f="4036">,</offsets><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10221" xml_f="10222" txt_i="4036" txt_f="4037">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10229" xml_f="10406" txt_i="4037" txt_f="4214">].

To create awareness, the importance of evidence-based information and education was emphasized. For example, consistent online and offline information can educate patients and health care providers and professionals and consequently increase the intrinsic motivation to change certain unhealthy behavior that are not often addressed in health care and PCC. It was suggested that awareness in general can be increased by offering PCC through employers or, even better, through secondary schools integrated within biology or sex education lessons. The health care providers and professionals recognize the fact that patients are familiar with the broad and inconsistent spectrum of online information regarding PCC and notice that especially higher-educated patients use the Internet to obtain information regarding fertility and pregnancy, whereas more lower-educated patients with limited health literacy and the highest health risks prefer to visit a professional first:</offsets></p><disp-quote><p><offsets xml_i="57725" xml_f="57875" txt_i="22964" txt_f="23114">It feels like selling something to someone who doesn’t want to buy it.

In addition to monitoring, they were concerned whether mHealth can reach and educate those who need it the most, for example due to a language barrier. Therefore, it is suggested that developing apps in multiple languages will overcome this. If so, it is believed that mHealth can be used to substitute for certain elements of routine consultations (eg, nutrition and lifestyle recommendations). Replacing consultations by alternative techniques, such as video chat, is believed to be an upcoming development, but is currently not appreciated due to the lack of technical support and security.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="59013" xml_f="59493" txt_i="24138" txt_f="24618">All health care providers and professionals were very enthusiastic about the concept of using an online questionnaire, such as the one incorporated in the Smarter Pregnancy platform, including a link between the given answers and the patient’s medical record.

Consequently, the main strength of this study is the involvement of several end users of our mHealth platform (ie, participants of the Smarter Pregnancy RCT), including the participation of men. Also, we included multiple health care providers and other professionals, representing various organizations and professions in the field of PCC, which is an important strength. These professionals were able to state their own opinion, substantiated by the policy of the organization or profession they represent. Due to the careful stratification and composition of the focus groups, we created a safe environment for the patients in which the structured discussion took place.
