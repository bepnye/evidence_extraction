It incorporates a large sample size; has a 24-month follow-up period, thereby allowing assessment of medium-term program effectiveness; includes several important secondary outcomes (levels of physical activity and proficiency in fundamental movement skills, quality of life, diet quality and food habits) and requires only minimal, readily accessible and inexpensive equipment to assist transferability to community settings. It is a unique study that addresses many of the shortfalls in the current literature pertaining to the efficacy of childhood obesity interventions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37183" xml_f="37668" txt_i="28218" txt_f="28703">The results of the study will provide much needed information about the efficacy and feasibility of treatment approaches in childhood overweight and obesity.
