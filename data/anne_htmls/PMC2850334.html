The MRCs in the Netherlands are operated by three main organizations for low vision care: Visio and Sensis (as of January 2010: Royal Visio), and Bartiméus. Patients were included at nine regional centers: Bartiméus participated with one MRC in the east of the Netherlands, Sensis participated with three MRCs in the south of the Netherlands and Visio participated with five MRCs in the north and southwest of the Netherlands. Of each organization one representative (a clinical physicist), with knowledge of CCTVs and training in their use, discussed with the low vision therapists (mostly occupational therapists) the duration, frequency and content of training programs given prior to the start of the present study. Furthermore, they discussed possible improvements, which could be incorporated into the new training protocol. A focus group was then organized, attended by the representatives of the three organizations and the authors, in which the outcome of the literature search and the outcomes of the discussions within each organization were further explored. It came to light that a considerable number of low vision therapists did not offer structured training. The duration and amount of training, as well as the manner in which patients were trained, differed per trainer and between the different MRCs. Some exercise books on training in the use of CCTVs existed within the MRCs, which could be used in the design of the protocol. Within the focus group an initial design for the protocol was constructed, which was then adapted by the authors. A discussion group was held in which the adapted version of the protocol was discussed with 12 low vision therapists, and the protocol was sent, twice, to 36 therapists at the nine participating MRCs. Only minor revisions were necessary, before consensus regarding the final content of the protocol was reached.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="16393" xml_f="16436" txt_i="10515" txt_f="10558">Final content of the CCTV training protocol</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16447" xml_f="17125" txt_i="10559" txt_f="11237">In designing the final content of the training protocol, the age of the actual users of CCTVs was taken into account. In the Netherlands the majority of CCTV users is estimated to be above the age of 70 years. Many older visually impaired patients cannot concentrate for long periods. Therefore, based on the experience of the low vision therapists, two 30 minute sessions separated by a break of 15 to 30 minutes were scheduled. The frequency of training was once a week. The amount of training depended on the learning strategies of the individual patients. Patients were trained until they had practiced with every assignment or until no further improvement could be reached.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17132" xml_f="17138" txt_i="11238" txt_f="11244">Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="17170" xml_f="17171" txt_i="11244" txt_f="11245">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17178" xml_f="17422" txt_i="11245" txt_f="11489"> summarizes the main components of the CCTV training protocol.

To enable objective measurements, videotapes were used to register the time spent reading, to record reading mistakes whilst participants were reading aloud and to score the patients' skills to operate the CCTV.

The protocol consists of various chapters including several exercises within each chapter. The focus of the training protocol is on ergonomics, basic operation skills, reading, writing, looking at pictures and photographs, and carrying out hobbies. An RCT was conducted to test the effectiveness of the protocol by comparing an intervention group, i.e. patients who receive both instructions provided by the supplier and the new standard training, with a control group, i.e. patients who receive only the instructions from the supplier.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39082" xml_f="39303" txt_i="26056" txt_f="26277">The study will concentrate on predictors of training effects.

Moreover, we expect that low vision specialists will be able to use our results in deciding which patients will be eligible for training in the future, for example patients with a certain visual acuity or patients who suffer from non-visual co-morbid conditions. Finally, optometrists may have a better indication for referring patients to MRCs for additional training. Moreover, by studying patient files and obtaining data from the participants during the home visits, this study will provide knowledge about the process of counseling and prescribing CCTVs to visually impaired adults (e.g. knowledge about which patients were prescribed a CCTV and about their rehabilitation needs). Consequently, the process of delivering CCTVs will become more transparent. At the time the study was conducted, the exact content of the instructions suppliers provide when they deliver CCTVs to patients' homes was unknown, as well as the time taken for these instructions. We decided not to inform suppliers about the study, to avoid them starting to over perform on their usual instructions, which may vary somewhere between no instructions to basic instructions on how to operate the CCTV. If they would have been informed, a smaller effect of the new standard protocol for CCTV training may be expected. Also, we did not know in advance which supplier would be involved in delivering a CCTV to a particular eligible patient. This depends on the insurance company of the patient and the rehabilitation center that has CCTVs of specific providers on display. In the course of the present study information about these instructions was obtained from participants. Comparability between the treatment and control group with regard to the instructions of the suppliers will be investigated.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41195" xml_f="42294" txt_i="28085" txt_f="29184">There are some limitations to the present study. First, the recruitment of participants by the MRCs took longer than expected. Reasons for this delay were: lack of eligible patients, lack of interest of clients, workload of low vision specialists who were required to invite eligible participants and ethical considerations of a low vision specialist who had conscientious objections to inviting participants with a need for CCTV training. This low vision specialist only invited patients who needed a CCTV, but who could manage without training, so that it would not matter if a patient would be randomized into the control group. Although several actions had been undertaken to convince the low vision specialist of the purpose of the study, and that all eligible patients with a CCTV indication should be invited, it did not work out properly. For this particular MRC, this has caused a selection bias which may lead to an underestimation of the treatment effect which influences generalizability of the results. Therefore, data will be analyzed with and without patients from this specific site.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42301" xml_f="42773" txt_i="29185" txt_f="29657">Second, we only focused on CCTVs with stand mounted cameras and/or displays, since these are the types that are most commonly prescribed in the Netherlands. In addition to stand mounted CCTVs, there are 'mouse' style CCTVs and CCTVs with handheld or head-mounted cameras. All of these devices are more portable than stand mounted CCTVs. However, battery power options tend to be heavy and expensive and, mouse style CCTVs especially, have a limited range of magnification[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="42805" xml_f="42807" txt_i="29657" txt_f="29659">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42814" xml_f="43052" txt_i="29659" txt_f="29897">].

For instance, to standardize the frequency and the total minutes of training each participant receives, as well as the amount of time practicing with each assignment. However, in daily practice it is very important to amplify care to the characteristics of the individual patient (e.g. learning abilities, endurance and limitations due to co-morbidity). For this reason, training was adjusted to the rehabilitation needs of the participants as well as to their learning style and learning rate, e.g. when participants had major problems with reading, the reading assignments were practiced more intensely. Another advantage of this method is that when the training program has been proven effective, only a few adjustments might be necessary before implementing the protocol in daily practice.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44008" xml_f="44682" txt_i="30802" txt_f="31476">Finally, it would have been preferable to offer placebo-training to the control group, to rule out a Hawthorne effect. An attention deficit in this group may result in a poorer outcome, e.g. a lower experienced quality of life. However, the study of Reeves et al. did not show significant differences in task performance and quality of life between patients who received conventional low vision rehabilitation enhanced by home visits from a rehabilitation officer (who gave advice and demonstrations on the use of LVAs, supplied alternative LVAs and provided patient support) or from a community care worker (who did service as a control for the contact time with patients)[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"><offsets xml_i="44714" xml_f="44716" txt_i="31476" txt_f="31478">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44723" xml_f="44725" txt_i="31478" txt_f="31480">].</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44747" xml_f="44757" txt_i="31482" txt_f="31492">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44768" xml_f="45105" txt_i="31493" txt_f="31830">We believe that the limitations of the study can be considered small compared to the information the study will provide: a new standard training protocol was developed to instruct visually impaired adults in the use of CCTVs.
