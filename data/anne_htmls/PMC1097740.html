All students in participating schools were asked to nominate students they viewed as influential in different respects, and those nominated students were invited to train to take on the role of 'peer supporter'. Training for these peer supporters was undertaken by health promotion trainers (who had themselves been trained to deliver the intervention in a standardised way). The two-day training course for peer supporters was provided for each school at a venue away from the school premises, and aimed to: increase knowledge about the health, economic, social and environmental risks of smoking; emphasise the benefits of remaining smoke-free; and encourage the development of skills to enable peer supporters to promote non-smoking among their peers. After this training, peer supporters were asked to intervene informally in everyday situations over a ten-week period to encourage their peers not to smoke, and were asked to keep a diary record of these informal conversations. Four follow-up visits to each school were made by the health promotion trainers over this ten-week period to provide further training to the peer supporters and to monitor their progress. Students who submitted a completed diary at the end of this ten-week period were given a £10 gift voucher in recognition of their contribution to the project.

These meetings were conducted with a member of the school's senior management team, and included detail on the commitment required from schools. The importance of the randomised design was emphasised, and it was made clear to schools that it would be preferable for schools to decline participation than to join the study and then withdraw at a later point. Six schools withdrew before random selection and a further eight were excluded from the trial (since they had fewer than 60 students in Year 8, were special schools, or were involved in another anti-smoking initiative).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13699" xml_f="14700" txt_i="8862" txt_f="9863">One hundred and thirteen schools remained interested in participating, from which the 66 schools required were randomly selected.

The 97 state schools were stratified by country (Wales or England) and whether the proportion of students entitled to free school meals was above or below the national averages (as an indicator of the socio-economic status of the school catchment area). Within these strata, schools were then listed according to Year 8 size. A systematic random sample was taken using a one-in-two sampling fraction, giving a further 50 schools.

The two single-sex schools were not treated as a separate stratum since one was a boys' school and the other a girls' school. State schools were further grouped into eight strata, defined by (i) whether they were in Wales or England, (ii) whether they had a year size greater or less than the median (200 students), and (iii) whether they had greater or less than the median proportion of students entitled to free school meals (19%). To ensure concealment, the sequence in which schools were allocated was determined by one of the trial's principal investigators.
