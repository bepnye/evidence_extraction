We will compare baseline characteristics in the two treatment groups and if incomparability appears, we will in secondary analysis, adjust for differences. The primary outcome, significant pain relief, will be compared between groups using analysis of variance for repeated measures. If adjustment for possible baseline incomparability is needed, analysis of covariance will be done. Since we expect that the difference between the two groups will become evident from 3 months onwards, the analysis will also be performed only using scores before and 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22024" xml_f="22034" txt_i="16033" txt_f="16043">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22045" xml_f="22242" txt_i="16044" txt_f="16241">The VERTOS IV study is a RCT comparing PV with a sham intervention using strict inclusion criteria designed to assess pain relief in patients with an acute osteoporotic VCF with mid-term follow-up.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22264" xml_f="22283" txt_i="16243" txt_f="16262">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22294" xml_f="22352" txt_i="16263" txt_f="16321">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22374" xml_f="22396" txt_i="16323" txt_f="16345">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22407" xml_f="22522" txt_i="16346" txt_f="16461">All authors conceived of the study and participated in the design.
