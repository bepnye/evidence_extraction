TRA comprises small molecules (molecular weight 157 Daltons) that interfere with the connection point of lysine to plasminogen and their product of transforming to plasmin. It exclusively prevents plasmin from accessing fibrin and has no other direct effect on hemostasis. Conversely, aprotinin, which is a non-exclusive serine inhibitor, directly inhibits plasmin in low density and makes the contact phase of the inner route of hemostasis easy in high density, thus resulting to minimal anti-coagulation effects (</offsets><xref rid="A40409R38" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="27237" xml_f="27239" txt_i="14076" txt_f="14078">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27246" xml_f="27771" txt_i="14078" txt_f="14603">).

The most common surgical side effect of prostatectomy is bleeding, but any attempt to use hemostatic agents to control it has not been successful. TRA is a safe and effective drug for reducing bleeding during and after surgery in prostatectomy and is recommended for routine use. Future studies can perform ROTEM (rotational thromboelastometry) and measure the intraoperative hemoglobin level.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the research development center of Sina hospital for its technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="A40409R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Meigs</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohr</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Barry</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Risk factors for clinical benign prostatic hyperplasia in a community-based population of healthy aging men.</article-title><source>J Clin Epidemiol.</source><year>2011</year><volume>54</volume><fpage>935</fpage><lpage>44</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="A40409R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kumsar, Ş.</surname></name><name><surname>Dirim, A.</surname></name><name><surname>Toksöz, S.</surname></name><name><surname>Sağlam, H.
