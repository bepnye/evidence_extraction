Although patients were not involved in the design of the modules, our team has previous experience in designing such modules for other health conditions, and we did test the robot with a few patients before the study began to gather feedback and check its usability.

Patients rang the physiotherapists when they experienced technical issues during the study, including network connection issues, touch screen failures, and hard disk failures on the robot, and the Smartinhalers not charging or connecting correctly. Another issue concerned the pulse oxygen devices, which occasionally became unplugged or had driver issues.

Calls were mostly from patients in the robot group, as very few patients from the control group contacted the physiotherapists about the Smartinhalers, even if they experienced problems. Most issues could be fixed over the phone, but in a few instances the physiotherapists and/or engineers had to visit the participant’s house. In all cases, the effects of technical failures were negative on patients’ attitudes toward the robots.

The primary outcome was number of days in hospital, which was not significantly different. This is consistent with recent large-scale studies on telehealth for COPD showing no reductions in hospitalizations [</offsets><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="75169" xml_f="75171" txt_i="37165" txt_f="37167">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="75178" xml_f="75179" txt_i="37167" txt_f="37168">,</offsets><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="75213" xml_f="75215" txt_i="37168" txt_f="37170">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="75222" xml_f="75579" txt_i="37170" txt_f="37527">]. The study extends research into the delivery of such care to a robot platform. While the robot did not significantly reduce hospitalizations, many patients appeared to appreciate the robot’s capacity to offer companionship, which may offer benefits over other kinds of platforms such as computers or iPads, although this needs to be further investigated.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="75586" xml_f="76529" txt_i="37528" txt_f="38471">The intervention improved adherence to both medication and rehabilitation exercise. Electronic recording showed that adherence to long-acting inhalers was significantly higher in the intervention group. This is backed up by the self-report data showing higher overall medication adherence in the intervention group, which was significantly better than the control group after controlling for past hospitalizations and comorbidities. More frequent use of the medication reminder function on the robot was associated with higher adherence, which suggests the robot was helpful in this regard for at least some patients. Self-reported adherence to rehabilitation exercises significantly increased in the intervention group compared with the control group. It is possible that the social aspects and embodiment of the robot combined with the increased availability of the exercise instructions and the reminders to together create behavior change.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="76536" xml_f="77132" txt_i="38472" txt_f="39068">A reduced length of stay might reflect that patients with robots were more comfortable being discharged because of the robot’s presence in the home and the fact that they were being more closely monitored by the physiotherapists. The physiotherapists intervened when they noticed adherence was suboptimal. An illustrative example was when a physiotherapist noticed that the Smartinhaler reliever was used over 30 times in a few minutes, the physiotherapist rang the patient and consulted with a respiratory clinician. The result was a change in medication for the patient and improved management.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="77139" xml_f="77928" txt_i="39069" txt_f="39858">About 75% of the sample responded to the robot positively and commented that it helped with medication, education, and companionship. However, 25% of participants did not find the robot useful, and some patients returned it. The patients who did not find it useful tended to have higher adherence at baseline. This suggests that patients should be screened and only offered a robot if they have poor adherence, because this group is the most likely to experience benefits. It also suggests the need to introduce the robot and its functions to the patient when they are an inpatient so that they can make a more informed decision about whether to accept treatment. Anxious patients may find additional benefits from the social presence of the robot, and this is an area for future research.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="77935" xml_f="78351" txt_i="39859" txt_f="40275">The robot was programmed to take weekly measurements in the hope of identifying downward trends (which would potentially require a change in management) without placing undue burden on the patient. However, daily measurements are likely better for this purpose. The measurements did serve as a baseline for comparison if patients who contacted us were concerned about a possible exacerbation or deteriorating health.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="78373" xml_f="78384" txt_i="40277" txt_f="40288">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="78395" xml_f="78796" txt_i="40289" txt_f="40690">This study was limited by a small sample, deaths, and dropout, which means the study was underpowered. Our original sample size calculation was optimistic, and a more realistic analysis could have been achieved if it was based on length of hospital stay in COPD patients in the region. The average length of stay in NZ for COPD admissions in 2012 was 4.37 days, and this has been declining over time [</offsets><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="78829" xml_f="78830" txt_i="40690" txt_f="40691">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="78837" xml_f="79643" txt_i="40691" txt_f="41497">]. For Middlemore hospital over the course of this study, the average length of stay was 4.2 days. The results suggest the intervention had small effects, if any, on hospitalizations, and thus a large sample (similar to recent telehealth trials) would be required to find effects if no changes were made to the robot or protocol in a future study. An additional limitation was that, at baseline, there was a trend that the intervention group had more previous hospitalization days and comorbidities, which could have affected the results. The nonblinding of participants was another limitation, which is common for eHealth trials. The benefit-cost analysis should be viewed with caution because the hospitalization costs were not significantly different between groups—it is provided as an indication only.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="79650" xml_f="80225" txt_i="41498" txt_f="42073">The study was conducted in South Auckland, where there is a large population of Māori, Pacific Islanders, and immigrants, and many patients have low socioeconomic status. About a third of the patients were living in rural areas. While these are key groups to target because they tend to have poorer health outcomes, the results may not generalize to all regions. Running the study for a longer period may help indicate whether increased adherence to medication and exercise recommendations could translate into improved quality of life and/or a reduction in hospitalizations.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="80247" xml_f="80258" txt_i="42075" txt_f="42086">Future Work</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="80269" xml_f="81301" txt_i="42087" txt_f="43119">A number of technical issues would need to be improved before the robot could be implemented on a larger scale, including reliability of the robots and the Internet network. An information technology support company would have to be involved to provide technical support. As a result of this pilot study, the team has now created a software mode to enable the robot to function offline if the network fails intermittently. The software team is working on linking the medication management software with a national electronic prescription database so that medications can be downloaded after the normal entry by pharmacies. In the future, the robot software will need to be integrated with primary care and other Web-based health platforms. Robot studies are expensive, as currently robots must be purchased, programmed, and supported for the purpose of the study. In addition, achieving software reliability is challenging for a study as there is little time for iterative improvement and for establishing a mature software version.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="81308" xml_f="81917" txt_i="43120" txt_f="43729">A larger study with more power to detect effects is recommended after improvements to the technology and the trial design are made. It may be useful to screen patients to give the robot only to those who are low in adherence and/or health literacy or who have high levels of anxiety or who are living by themselves. Further work is needed to investigate whether the robot has advantages over a computer tablet providing similar services in this population. The team could possibly program the robot for other long-term conditions such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis if given sufficient development time.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="81924" xml_f="82619" txt_i="43730" txt_f="44425">The majority of COPD patients admitted to hospital are managed in general medical wards and by a team not involved in their long-term care. Our experience suggests that physiotherapists and respiratory nurse specialists involved in long-term care (eg, pulmonary rehabilitation, outpatient care, outreach or integrated care programs) are ideal people to implement telehealth programs using robots. Many patients recruited into this study appeared to be on suboptimal bronchodilator therapy with insufficient numbers on long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) in particular. In NZ, access to LAMAs is through special authority application, and patients can only be prescribed LAMAs if their FEV</offsets><sub><offsets xml_i="82624" xml_f="82625" txt_i="44425" txt_f="44426">1</offsets></sub><offsets xml_i="82631" xml_f="82928" txt_i="44426" txt_f="44717"> is &lt;60% predicted. Spirometry was infrequently recorded on patients during their admission, and &lt;50% of general practitioners in NZ have spirometers. This nonadherence to international guidelines might be one reason as to why NZ has the fourth highest admission rates for COPD in the world.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="82935" xml_f="83696" txt_i="44718" txt_f="45479">Ideally, patients would be introduced to the robot while in hospital to gauge whether they like the concept and can adapt to the measurement requirements. They would also benefit from a formal review by a respiratory physician before discharge. Some thought also needs to be given as to how to achieve a 24-hour monitoring of the Web server’s patient information 7 days a week. This would potentially require a national or regional solution that includes a 24/7 monitoring system such as an extension of the New Zealand Healthline, with instant links back to the health care team members when patients are becoming unstable. A similar solution for diabetes and asthma management could be set up, which would reduce costs and pay for infrastructural development.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="83718" xml_f="83729" txt_i="45481" txt_f="45492">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="83740" xml_f="84137" txt_i="45493" txt_f="45890">A robot may be useful for COPD patients who are struggling with medication adherence and rehabilitation exercises to improve adherence, although hospitalizations may not be reduced.
