Its ease in administration, less cost in comparison to other methods such as injection, and also more decrease in the severity of vomiting than other medications can be the reasons to suggest that ondansetron be a better choice for preventing PONV. Despite the effect that ondansetron had more on PONV decrease in all postoperative periods in comparison to cetirizine, the difference was not significant except for nausea during the 2-12 h after operation which was significant.
