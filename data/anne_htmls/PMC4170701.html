(1) It was prospective, randomized, and blinded to the evaluators. (2) Exercise intervention study in Taiwanese patients with AS has never been reported before. (3) Comparison of different home exercise programs has rarely been reported, even in the Western population. (4) The baseline and postexercise evaluations were very extensive, including aerobic capacity, pulmonary function, range-of-motion of the spine, chest expansion, functional ability, and other disease-related measures. However, our study has some limitations, First, the sample size of 9 or 10 in each group was small, and the statistical power for chest expansion (21%), finger-to-floor distance (40.2%), MET at peak cardiovascular response (12%), and FVC (11.5%) was low. More cases are needed for evaluating change of spinal range- of- motion and pulmonary function test. Secondly, the study did not provide long-term follow-up (e.g., 6 months, 1 year), and thus we did not know whether the exercise effects would be maintained after a long exercise program. Thirdly, we monitored patients once in 2 weeks. A more frequent monitoring by phone or other means might increase the exercise effect. Fourthly, the average duration of disease in patients with AS was more than 11 years, and some patients had severe contracture or fusion of the spinal joints. If we could select patients with shorter duration or with a more flexible spine, the exercise effect might be improved.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title><offsets xml_i="38088" xml_f="38102" txt_i="24977" txt_f="24991">5. Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38113" xml_f="38574" txt_i="24992" txt_f="25453">This study demonstrated that a 3-month home-based combined (aerobic, strengthening, and range-of-motion) exercise program significantly improved aerobic capacity and functional ability (BASFI) in patients with AS and was superior to home-based range-of-motion exercise alone. Exercise prescription for patients with AS should include range-of-motion (or stretching), strengthening, and aerobic components and should be started in the early stage of the disease.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Taiwan National Science Council.
