In spite of a gradual time-dependent decrease in antimicrobial activity of CHX, the results indicated that at the end of six weeks after canal obturation, CHX maintained over 95% of its antimicrobial activity regardless of the root filling material. Moreover, it was concluded that Resilon/RealSeal SE significantly decreased the antimicrobial activity of CHX in comparison with gutta-percha/AH26. Accordingly, it is suggested that after final irrigation with CHX, gutta-percha/AH26 would be a better choice for root canal obturation. Microorganisms are responsible for development of pulpal and periapical diseases and reinfection of root canals. Facultative bacteria, such as E. faecalis play a key role in recurrent infections of root canals [
