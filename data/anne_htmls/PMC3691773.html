The implementation of the study protocol will be monitored and documented by the research team. Quantitative data will be collected for program use, for example login frequency and frequency of use of each intervention component. The web-based questionnaire, will be used to ask participants of the intervention group, who did not use the intervention, to provide a reason for this (not enough time; not necessary, because I live healthy; not necessary, because I think I am not at risk for or do not have COPD; I wanted to visit the website, but I could not login to the website; other reason). Participants who used the intervention will be asked questions largely based on earlier work of de Vries et al.

Data will be analysed according to the intention to treat principle. In addition, a per-protocol analysis will be conducted. For this analysis, it is required that participants complete at least one intervention component. The uncorrected and corrected effect of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcome measures at 6 months will be assessed with logistic regression for categorical outcomes and linear regression for numerical outcomes. As for correction, baseline characteristics related to the outcome at 6 months are included in the regression model to increase the precision of the intervention effect. Since randomisation is stratified by recruitment method (online or through general practices), recruitment method is also included as a covariate in these analyses. As a sensitivity analysis, the differences in baseline characteristics between the groups recruited online and through the practices are compared. If this analysis shows that the groups are comparable, the analyses will be applied to the whole dataset, otherwise the groups will be analysed separately.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33651" xml_f="34063" txt_i="25249" txt_f="25661">Quantitative process evaluation data will be analysed using descriptive statistics, such as number (%) and mean (SD).

This recruitment strategy resulted in an insufficient number of participants. Not all eligible patients were invited by the nurses and many patients declined participation. We concluded that it is not feasible to recruit 446 participants per arm using this approach.
