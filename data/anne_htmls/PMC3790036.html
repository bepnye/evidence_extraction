We enrolled 20 patients to account for a 10% drop out rate. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the demographic data using the ANOVA test for continuous variables (i.e., age, weight, height, and duration of pneumoperitoneum) and the Kruskal-Wallis rank test for ASA status. To study the effects of time and group allocation on each of the variables, repeated-measure ANOVA was used to compare the respiratory mechanics parameters between baseline values and time (six levels). When an overall difference was detected, the Student-Newman-Keuls post-test was used to localize the significant differences. One-way ANOVA was used between groups, and multiple comparisons were made with the Dunn's method when the results were significant. The data were expressed as mean ± SD (number).
