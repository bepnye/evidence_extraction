Also, in the particular economic circumstance of the country, it is important to try and locally produce medications that require valuable foreign currency to import. Thus, considering local production of these drugs and implementation of different approval stages, this study was conducted to compare the effects of foreign (Novartis Pharma Canada) and Iranian-produced oxytocin (Oxitip, Caspian Tamin Company) in labor induction in term and post-term deliveries. If the Iranian drug is efficient, it will help self-sufficiency of the country in pharmaceutical production. Through comparison of the locally-produced and foreign produced oxytocin, we can determine its particular side-effects and report them to the manufacturer in order to improve this drug. With its improved quality, or similarity of studied effects, this drug can be marketed globally, thereby reducing unwanted import costs of the drug.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title><offsets xml_i="10572" xml_f="10593" txt_i="5830" txt_f="5851">Materials and methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10604" xml_f="10885" txt_i="5852" txt_f="6133">This study was a randomized double-blind clinical trial that was performed from 2012 till September 2013 in the Academic Medical Centre, the Vali-e-Asr Hospital, Tehran, Iran, with a target population of 220 pregnant women with live fetus and cephalic presentation and more than 37</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="10890" xml_f="10892" txt_i="6133" txt_f="6135">th</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="10898" xml_f="10924" txt_i="6135" txt_f="6161"> week of gestational age (</offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001"><offsets xml_i="10957" xml_f="10963" txt_i="6161" txt_f="6167">Fig. 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10970" xml_f="11396" txt_i="6167" txt_f="6593">).

In a study by Charoenboon, cesarean rate caused by CPD increased from 3.2% in 1992 to 7.8% in 2011, which was more common than other indication like breech presentation, fetal distress, and multiple pregnancy [13]. As for Vali-e-Asr Hospital is a referral and teaching hospital, perhaps reports of high number of cesarean cases may be due to reasons other than oxytocin use. Selection of subjects with no particular risk factors largely reduced this limitation.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0005"><title><offsets xml_i="32782" xml_f="32792" txt_i="16834" txt_f="16844">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32803" xml_f="32977" txt_i="16845" txt_f="17019">Both drugs had similar labor induction properties, and also similar effects on neonatal complications.
