Performing studies in gynecologic surgery is limited to the female population, further study could include either gender or higher-risk patients. Second, for reasons of practicality, it did not measure sophisticated indices of preload or afterload. To include all the desired parameters may require more time, and turn to non-continuous monitoring as a point of single parameter-likely therefore, missing closely-timed variations. Therefore, in this study we focused on clinically applicable DTI parameters, which seem relatively less load-dependent and easy to perform.

This suggests a specific drug-dependent impact on myocardial performance during the anesthesia induction. Further studies are warranted to understand the clinical implications--these may affect the choice of induction anesthesia agent during pre-operative patient
