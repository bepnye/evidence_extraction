Seronegative patients and who do not meet the NMO criteria are classified as having NMO Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), but are treated identically to clinically definite NMO. Acute relapse is treated with intravenous methylprednisolone for 5 days with or without subsequent treatment with plasma exchange (PE). This must be followed by oral steroid to prevent rebound worsening and further relapse. For relapse prevention, immunosuppressive agents that have been found to be effective are azathioprine, rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and mitoxantrone; although none of which have been validated in randomized, controlled trial. Some patients do relapse with monotherapy, and switching to more effective agent or use of combination therapy is beneficial in such situation. There is no consensus about the duration of preventive therapy, but generally 2-3 years of relapse-free period is considered the minimum, taking into account the risks of long-term toxicity of these agents.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Aquaporin-4</kwd><kwd>drug therapy</kwd><kwd>immunosuppression</kwd><kwd>neuromyelitis optica</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title><offsets xml_i="4447" xml_f="4459" txt_i="1253" txt_f="1265">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4470" xml_f="4871" txt_i="1266" txt_f="1667">Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, with a predilection for the optic nerves and spinal cord.

Absence of new clinical relapses during a long period of preventive therapy (&gt; 2 years) is generally viewed as probable treatment success. Weinshenker and colleagues suggested that NMO-IgG seropositive patients who present with a first ever attack of LETM should be treated with immunosuppression for 5 years. Although, there is no consensus about the duration of preventive therapy, it is generally decided based on the potential benefits of therapy during a period of higher relapse risk (the first 2-3 years after presentation) against the risks of long-term toxicity of the agent, particularly treatment-related malignancy. While deciding to stop treatment, the clinician must discuss the matter with the patient taking into account the duration of treatment, history of relapse (frequency, severity, and recovery), treatment toxicity (actual or potential), and other factors (e. g., a woman's desire to become pregnant).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title><offsets xml_i="15948" xml_f="15962" txt_i="11032" txt_f="11046">Corticosteroid</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="15973" xml_f="17388" txt_i="11047" txt_f="12462">Generally oral steroid is continued after the treatment of an acute attack, then its dose is slowly reduced once the steroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy becomes effective, thereby reducing the risks of long-term side effects of steroid. Daily or alternate day regimen of oral prednisolone is commonly used at a starting dose of up to 1 mg/kg. The first-line steroid-sparing agents are introduced while prednisolone is still continued in the same dosage. The prednisolone is usually reduced to a maintenance dose over 6 months while steroid-sparing agents are taking effect. After this period if the patient remains stable, a further tapering of the dose of prednisolone may be tried. However, owing to the risk of relapse which makes patient severely disable as against other antibody-mediated disease like myasthenia gravis, it is difficult to recommend withdrawal of steroid in NMO. Many NMO patients are steroid dependent and it has been seen that maintaining with a low dose of prednisolone (10-20 mg daily or an equivalent alternate-day regimen) is effective in preventing attack. Monitoring NMO-IgG antibody titer may prove to be useful for monitoring individual patients, particularly if tested at times relevant to treatment changes and during relapse, to compare with levels during stable periods.

Till date, the use of combination therapy in NMO has been limited to oral corticosteroids (prednisolone or prednisone) plus immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine and cyclosporine. The combination has demonstrated a reduction in ARR and EDSS. Other effective combinations are intermittent PE with immunosuppressant, or intermittent IVIg in combination with immunosuppressant. Prospective studies comparing combination therapy, sequential therapy, and induction therapy will be needed to balance benefits and risks.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec1-7"><title><offsets xml_i="33665" xml_f="33687" txt_i="27208" txt_f="27230">Selection of Therapies</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33698" xml_f="34415" txt_i="27231" txt_f="27948">While choosing an agent, consideration must be given about the efficacy as per available clinical data, toxicity profile, and the cost of therapy. Owing to the more-extensive availability of clinical data; azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab tend to be the most-recommended first-line therapies for NMO prophylaxis. However, considering the cost of therapy and the potential side effect of severe infection, rituximab is to be used with caution. Second-line therapies include methotrexate, mitoxantrone, and cyclosporine. Due to the potential toxicity of mitoxantrone and the limited clinical data on methotrexate and cyclosporine, physicians should consider restricting their use to refractory cases [</offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T3"><offsets xml_i="34447" xml_f="34454" txt_i="27948" txt_f="27955">Table 3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34461" xml_f="34463" txt_i="27955" txt_f="27957">].</offsets></p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="34511" xml_f="34518" txt_i="27958" txt_f="27965">Table 3</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="34538" xml_f="34584" txt_i="27965" txt_f="28011">Therapy of acute attack and relapse prevention</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AIAN-18-16-g004"></graphic></table-wrap><p><offsets xml_i="34662" xml_f="35296" txt_i="28012" txt_f="28646">In patients with severe onset of NMO/NMOSD use of therapeutic agents which have already had reported success in reducing relapses like rituximab is justified. It is generally considered that such patients are more vulnerable to further severe attacks. In patients with mild onset, given the perceived need for long-term immunosuppression in patients with NMO/NMOSD, and given the excellent safety profile of azathioprine and methotrexate, these can be used as initial therapy. Elderly patients, being perhaps more susceptible to side effects of chronic immune suppression, may be good candidates for initial therapy with methotrexate.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35303" xml_f="36236" txt_i="28647" txt_f="29580">The NMO exacerbation does not increases in pregnancy, but increases in the postpartum period and in the year following childbirth. Azathioprine, mycophenolate, and methotrexate are pregnancy category D or X (D - adverse effects on fetus in human studies and X - adverse effects on fetus in human and animal studies) and should not be continued during pregnancy. Although rituximab and prednisone are pregnancy class C (adverse effects on fetus in animal studies without good data from human studies), the absence of an increase in ARR during pregnancy makes continued therapy during pregnancy questionable unless the patient displays evidence of renewed disease activity. Owing to increased relapse rate following delivery, rapid introduction of prophylactic therapy is warranted. However, the benefits of these therapies should be balanced against the benefits of breastfeeding. Till date, evidence comes from only one case report.[</offsets><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36270" xml_f="36272" txt_i="29580" txt_f="29582">40</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36279" xml_f="36280" txt_i="29582" txt_f="29583">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36287" xml_f="36962" txt_i="29584" txt_f="30259">Rituximab is also preferred for treatment failure after initial attempts with agents such as mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and methotrexate. It has been proven in several series that who failed with therapies before rituximab, stabilization ensued after changing to this monoclonal antibody. Head-to-head trials of rituximab versus other existing agents (like azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or methotrexate) for treatment of NMO/NMSD are deemed to be difficult to perform due to the rarity of the disorders, the long-term follow up that is needed, and the severe consequences of treatment failure among other factors.
