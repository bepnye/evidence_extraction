A group of 16 females, aged 80-93 years old, was divided into 2 groups according to their baseline DHEA-S levels: Lower Halves (N = 8) and Upper Halves (N = 8), and participated in a 4-month exercise intervention trial. Insulin response with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), cholesterol, blood pressure (BP), motor performance, and DHEA-S were determined at baseline and 4 months after the training program. Glucose tolerance and body mass index (BMI) remained unchanged with training for both groups. Insulin, fasted cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, reaction time, and locomotive function were significantly lowered by training only in the Upper Halves group. Changes in the area under curve of insulin (IAUC) were negatively correlated with the baseline DHEA-S level (R= - 0.60, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="4429" xml_f="4430" txt_i="1027" txt_f="1028">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="4439" xml_f="4607" txt_i="1028" txt_f="1193"> &lt; 0.05).

Exclusion criteria were musculo-skeletal disorders and cognitive or physical dysfunction interfering with test and training procedures. All subjects demonstrated a capability of finishing a continuous 6 minute walk. 16 females were eligible and were equally divided into two groups according to their baseline (pre-trained) saliva DHEA-S level: Lower Halves (N= 8, age 83.5±0.60 years, DHEA-S &lt; 2.2 ng/mL) and Upper Halves groups (N= 8, age 83.9±0.85 years, DHEA-S &gt; 2.2 ng/mL). The median value of pre-trained DHEA-S levels in the 16 women is 2.2 ng/mL. The normal reference ranges for salivary DHEA-S are 0.69-15.7 ng/mL (healthy young female, N=12) and 0.98-16.7 ng/mL (healthy young male, N=9). Therefore, DHEA-S level for the Lower Halves groups can be considered extremely low. Aims and methods were explained to all subjects, who then signed a formal consent.

Exercise used for the training included squat, leg extension, upright row, lateral pull-down, standing leg curls (ankle weights), and abdominal curls. All subjects were required to perform each repetition in a slow, controlled manner, with a rest of 2-3 minutes between sets. One or two sets of 12-15 repetitions were performed for all exercises at each training session. All sessions were supervised to ensure safety and correct techniques and to monitor the appropriate amount of exercises and rest intervals.

The physiologic mediator conveying the exercise training effect that diminished with age is currently unknown. In this study we examined the effect of a 4-month exercise program on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in a group of females aged 80-93 years, in relation to their baseline DHEA-S levels. We found that the normal exercise-training effect on improving insulin sensitivity was absent in the Lower Halves of DHEA-S subjects. The basal DHEA-S level of this group (0.60 ng/mL) is considered extremely low compared to healthy young females (0.69-15.7 ng/mL). The current study demonstrates that the oldest-old subjects with low DHEA-S level were poor responders to exercise-training adaptation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18024" xml_f="18094" txt_i="12659" txt_f="12729">Age is a well-recognized risk factor for insulin resistance syndromes </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="18125" xml_f="18126" txt_i="12729" txt_f="12730">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18133" xml_f="18213" txt_i="12730" txt_f="12810">, which includes a clustering of interrelated plasma lipid and BP abnormalities </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="18244" xml_f="18245" txt_i="12810" txt_f="12811">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18252" xml_f="18254" txt_i="12811" txt_f="12813">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="18285" xml_f="18286" txt_i="12813" txt_f="12814">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18293" xml_f="18295" txt_i="12814" txt_f="12816">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="18327" xml_f="18329" txt_i="12816" txt_f="12818">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18336" xml_f="18437" txt_i="12818" txt_f="12919">.

Under stress conditions, ATP demands are immediately increased. Carbohydrate fuel, as an anaerobic substrate, has the advantage of having a fast degradation rate and can occur in the absence of oxygen for rapid ATP resynthesis. Therefore, carbohydrate storage becomes crucial for survival under acute stress when the increasing oxygen delivery system takes longer to be fully recruited for fatty acid oxidation.

In addition, these low DHEA-S young subjects appear to be poor-responders to endogenous erythropoietin (EPO), as they exhibited greater EPO level at sea-level and altitude but exhibited an insignificant increase in red blood cell by prolonged altitude activity.
