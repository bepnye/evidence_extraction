There were 83 patients (of a total of 300 randomized participants) who exited the study and were lost to follow up. These patients had significantly higher serum CK-MB levels compared with those who completed follow-up assessments. It can be assumed that ACS of greater severity might have influenced attrition and thereby affected our findings. Finally, the potential risk of developing QTc prolongation should be considered for treating anxiety with escitalopram in patients with ACS.

Comprehensive evaluations were conducted, and well-validated psychiatric assessments were used in this study. Despite its high prevalence and negative impact on patients, there are currently no evidence-based practices for treating anxiety in the ACS population. The present findings indicate that escitalopram can be recommended as an effective and safe treatment option for treating anxiety in ACS patients, but larger studies from multicenter settings would increase their generalizability.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="19324" xml_f="19349" txt_i="12564" txt_f="12589">Supplementary
