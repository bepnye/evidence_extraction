This trial suggests that buprenorphine can supply a simple, speedy, safe, and suitable means of treatment of anxiety. Giving buprenorphine medication as single high dose looks to lower concerns of compliance, in addition to decreasing the possibility of buprenorphine being diverted for dependency and abuse. Likewise, the cost benefits appear to be favorable, primarily while considering the chance of using for outpatients without a necessity for admission to a hospital. Still, the findings of this research require to be repeated in a larger sample with a control group receiving a conventional mode of treatment and in an outpatient center.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title><offsets xml_i="15737" xml_f="15748" txt_i="9964" txt_f="9975">CONCLUSIONS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="15759" xml_f="15908" txt_i="9976" txt_f="10125">The results illustrated a significant reduction in anxiety symptoms within each of the three groups, but no difference in outcome between the groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15915" xml_f="16408" txt_i="10126" txt_f="10619">Our findings documented that giving a single high dose of buprenorphine might provide a simple, speedy, safe, and suitable means of anxiety reduction.
