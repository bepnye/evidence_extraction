There is no need for postoperative ventilation as such; since oxygen supplementation with a T piece with the patient breathing spontaneously will be more than sufficient, as the patient will tolerate the endotracheal tube due to absence of airway reflexes. The transtracheal block cannot be performed in patients with swelling in front of neck, local infection and is technically difficult in post burn contracture of neck.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16118" xml_f="16428" txt_i="10682" txt_f="10992">In the present study a bolus of propofol was used to deepen the plane of anesthesia, as it has a quicker onset of action which helped in quick control of any patient movement during microsurgery. Increasing concentration of inhalation agent would take time to attain a deeper plane as compared to IV injection.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16435" xml_f="16955" txt_i="10993" txt_f="11513">Transtracheal injection of lidocaine was found to be an effective alternative to propofol infusion in our study, especially when long acting muscle relaxants needed to be avoided. This technique can also be extrapolated to other surgeries where neuromuscular monitoring is needed, like in post brachial plexus injury patients undergoing nerve anastomosis. One of the weaknesses of this study is that there is a possibility that the study may be underpowered to elicit a significant difference between the two techniques.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16962" xml_f="17331" txt_i="11514" txt_f="11883">It is concluded that patient immobility and intraoperative hemodynamic stability during total parotidectomy under GA, with transtracheal block or intraoperative propofol infusion, are comparable. Hence, we recommend transtracheal block as a less expensive, safe, and successful alternative to propofol infusion during surgeries where muscle relaxants are to be avoided.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marchese-Ragona</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>De Filippis</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Marioni</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Staffieri</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment of complications of parotid gland surgery</article-title><source>Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital</source><year>2005</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>174</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16450773</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Terrell</surname><given-names>JE</given-names></name><name><surname>Kileny</surname><given-names>PR</given-names></name><name><surname>Yian</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Esclamado</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bradford</surname><given-names>CR</given-names></name><name><surname>Pillsbury</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>Clinical outcome of continuous facial nerve monitoring during primary parotidectomy</article-title><source>Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg</source><year>1997</year><volume>123</volume><fpage>1081</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9339985</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thiede</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Klüsener</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Sielenkämper</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Van Aken</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Stoll</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Schmäl</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Interference between muscle relaxation and facial nerve monitoring during parotidectomy</article-title><source>Acta Otolaryngol</source><year>2006</year><volume>126</volume><fpage>422</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16608797</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kimura</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Watanabe</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Asakura</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Inomata</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Okada</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Taguchi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Determination of end¯tidal sevoflurane concentration for tracheal intubation and minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration in adults</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1994</year><volume>79</volume><fpage>378</fpage><lpage>81</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7639383</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yakaitis</surname><given-names>RW</given-names></name><name><surname>Blitt</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Angiulo</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>End-tidal halothane concentration for endotracheal intubation</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>1977</year><volume>47</volume><fpage>386</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">900549</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pani</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Rath</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Regional &amp;
