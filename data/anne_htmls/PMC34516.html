In addition we used similar design and sample size to the published data. Another possibility is that the vitamin C levels were not sufficient to produce an effect. Again this is unlikely as this dose has been previously validated, we chose 2 g of ascorbic acid orally, administered at the same time as the methionine; this dose is known to increase plasma ascorbate concentrations 2.5-fold, with stable concentrations from 2 to 5 hours after dosing.
