They are used only in the horizontal plane, even though many activities of daily living (ADLs), for example the 'sit to stand' process are performed in the vertical plane. Making matters worse, these treatments are often perceived as tedious by patients. Therefore, our team developed a new balance trainer, a Balance Control Trainer (BCT). This system was developed to allow for exercises in both the horizontal and vertical planes. The system was composed of self-weight shifting exercises and video games that used visual feedback during task-specific lower limb exercises and video games that demonstrated weight shift not only the horizontal plane but also the vertical plane. Video games that use visual and auditory stimuli can improve patient satisfaction and enhance their compliance.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8221" xml_f="8400" txt_i="3608" txt_f="3787">The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility and effects of a BCT that applied the concept of vertical movement to improve mobility and balance in chronic stroke patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><offsets xml_i="8451" xml_f="8472" txt_i="3789" txt_f="3810">MATERIALS AND METHODS</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8492" xml_f="8504" txt_i="3811" txt_f="3823">Participants</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8515" xml_f="8647" txt_i="3824" txt_f="3956">Forty subjects were recruited in Daegu, South Korea, between March 2010 and February 2011.

Therefore the interventions that improve gait ability might have no influence on the activities of daily living in last 2 weeks.
