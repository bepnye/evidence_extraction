For example, many exercise programs attempt to strengthen the quadriceps muscle by extending the leg using a weight around the ankle with the exerciser seated upright in a chair. However, the length of the hamstring muscle usually limits this movement and, thus, to accomplish the exercise with this positioning, the exerciser must flex the lower back, creating a kyphotic posture and unnecessary pressure on the back. Instead, we exercise the quadriceps muscle in the supine position, with the legs supported by a half barrel, which allows the lumbar spine to rest in a neutral position (Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="19392" xml_f="19394" txt_i="12711" txt_f="12713">1a</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19401" xml_f="20022" txt_i="12713" txt_f="13334">). In the neutral position, the anterior superior iliac spine and symphysis pubis are in the same horizontal plane. The lumbar spine is in its natural concave curve, thus minimizing the potential for adverse stress on the back during exercise. When extending the leg, the exerciser is taught to align the ankle, knee, and hip along the longitudinal axis, in order to prevent injury to the knee. Understanding proper exercise technique in this way enables the exerciser to strengthen muscle groups that are essential for postural control without developing unnecessary tension in other muscles or improper postural habits.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20029" xml_f="20243" txt_i="13335" txt_f="13549">The control group performed six range of motion exercises for the lower limbs, using motions and repetitions similar to the resistance exercises, but carried out with passive motion produced by the physiotherapist.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20265" xml_f="20273" txt_i="13551" txt_f="13559">Measures</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20284" xml_f="20733" txt_i="13560" txt_f="14009">The primary outcome measures were participation and adherence.

They chose a minimally challenging exercise program because of their concern about the potential risks of exercising older hospitalized patients more vigorously. The authors commented that the low intensity of the exercises may be one reason the program failed to demonstrate a significant benefit in hospital length of stay, health indicators, mobility measures, and most functional measures. Our study is the first of which we are aware in which systematic evaluation of resistance exercise in the acute care setting demonstrates that an important proportion of selected at-risk older adults are able to safely comply with resistance exercise.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34457" xml_f="34467" txt_i="23307" txt_f="23317">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34478" xml_f="34961" txt_i="23318" txt_f="23801">Prescribing resistance exercise to targeted elderly, acutely ill, hospitalized patients results in acceptable compliance.
