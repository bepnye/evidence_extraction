Individual MET scores for walking, moderate and vigorous activity were calculated within each domain and combined to provide a total score using the following equations: total MET-minutes/week = Met-level × minutes per day × days per week, where 1 MET is equivalent to resting energy expenditure. According to the IPAQ questionnaire, we classified the physical activity into three categories, if the energy expenditure per week was less than 600 calorie, participants classified as light physical activity, if the energy expenditure per week during the last five days was 600 calorie, they classified as a moderate. If the energy expenditure per week reached 1500 calorie during the past 3 days or 3000 calorie during the last 7 days, they classified as vigorous level of physical activity [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="17112" xml_f="17114" txt_i="12392" txt_f="12394">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17121" xml_f="17123" txt_i="12394" txt_f="12396">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17130" xml_f="17362" txt_i="12397" txt_f="12629">Participants in the intervention group received a calendar and a pedometer (Omron, HJ-152K-E, China) to record their number of free-living steps per day.

Exploratory analysis (Kolmogorov- Smirnov test) revealed that baseline data of physical activity were not normally distributed. Non parametric tests were therefore used to analyze these data. Mann-Whitney U test was used for between group differences and Wilcoxon's signed -rank test was used to assess within-group changes over the time. Covariance analysis (ANCOVA) was used to test the health outcomes between-groups after the intervention with initial anthropometric measures as covariates.

anthropometric measures after childbirth. Postpartum visits in Iran typically occur at 10 days and 6 weeks postpartum. These visits cover the postpartum changes in the female reproductive system, family planning and breastfeeding. However, advice about weight loss or physical activity is not included in routine postpartum health care. Supporting the first hypothesis of this study, the intervention group demonstrated significant improvement in their physical activity. Pre-intervention responses to the IPAQ indicated that the majority of participants in both groups were performing only light physical activity at the start of the study. After the 12 week intervention none of the women in the intervention group were classified has having a light physical activity level, and they had significantly increased their physical activity level relative to the control group. This finding agrees with the results of other studies [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"><offsets xml_i="32265" xml_f="32267" txt_i="21500" txt_f="21502">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32274" xml_f="32592" txt_i="21502" txt_f="21820">].

As the purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of a tailored intervention program on physical activity and anthropometric measurements after childbirth, the results are specific to women in the postpartum period and may not be easily generalized to other populations. Additionally, all the women in this study breastfed their babies.

The data on physical activity levels were collected using the IPAQ, and recall bias may exist. Finally, participants were responsible for writing their number of steps per day in their calendars and the validity of these data depends on their honesty. The strength of this study is that it offers an option for increased physical activity compatible with the participants' lifestyles. Participating women could stay home and increase their physical activity while taking care of their babies. Outdoor activity in the hot and humid area of southwestern Iran (the study location) is difficult for almost 6 months a year.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34825" xml_f="34836" txt_i="23821" txt_f="23832">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34847" xml_f="35197" txt_i="23833" txt_f="24183">This study was a novel and comprehensive evaluation of the effect of the physical activity intervention using pedometer on physical activity and anthropometric measures in the postpartum period.
