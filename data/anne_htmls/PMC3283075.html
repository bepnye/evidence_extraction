Total dose and duration of rhFSH used for COS were significantly higher in GnRH agonist low-dose LP group than in GnRH antagonist MDP groups, which suggests the advantage of GnRH antagonist protocol. It is well known advantage of GnRH antagonist protocols compared with GnRH agonist LP, and Howles et al.

In group 1, the numbers of mature oocytes, fertilized oocytes and grade I, II embryos were comparable to those in group 3, whereas these were significantly lower in group 2. This implicates OCP pretreatment in GnRH antagonist MDP is effective in improving the ovarian response to COS and IVF outcome with similar level to GnRH agonist low-dose LP. In patients with elevated basal serum FSH levels by diminished ovarian reserve, antral follicle sizes during the early follicular phase are often markedly heterogeneous because FSH-sensitive follicles are early exposed to gradient FSH concentrations during the preceding luteal phase. Therefore, in poor responders, ovarian stimulation without pituitary suppression is likely to induce asynchronous follicular development and a limited number of dominant follicles. The COS results of present study may result from pituitary suppression prior to ovarian stimulation. Actually, a study by Fanchin et al.
