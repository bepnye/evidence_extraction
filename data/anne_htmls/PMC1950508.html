Traditionally self-management training for diabetes has been delivered in a didactic manner. In recent times alternatives to the traditional delivery of diabetes care have been investigated, for example, the concept of peer support which emphasises patient rather than professional domination. This paper describes the pilot study and protocol for a study that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a peer support intervention for people with type 2 diabetes in a primary care setting.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4522" xml_f="4536" txt_i="708" txt_f="722">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4547" xml_f="5549" txt_i="723" txt_f="1725">A pilot study was conducted to access the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of a peer support intervention. We used the MRC Framework for the evaluation of complex interventions. Elements of the intervention were defined and the study protocol was finalized. In this cluster randomised controlled trial twenty general practices are assigned to control and intervention groups. Each practice compiles a diabetes register and randomly selects 21 patients. All practices implement a standardised diabetes care system. In the intervention group all practices recruit three peer supporters. The peer supporters are trained to conduct nine group meetings in their general practice over a period of two years. Each meeting has a structured component. The primary outcomes are blood pressure, total cholesterol, HBA1c and the Diabetes Well-being score. In addition to biophysical, psychosocial, economic and health service utilization data peer supporter activity and qualitative data are collected.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5571" xml_f="5581" txt_i="1727" txt_f="1737">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5592" xml_f="5931" txt_i="1738" txt_f="2077">Peer support is a complex intervention and evaluating such an intervention presents challenges to researchers.

Health professionals and patients were interviewed and both were broadly supportive of the concept of lay advisors following the development of lay criteria, structured training and guidelines. Patients indicated a preference for a lay advisor over an unknown health professional and they identified the ability of lay advisors to enhance and support diabetes patient self-management.

Presenting the results of cost effectiveness studies requires reporting the incremental costs and effects of a new intervention relative to an alternative and then reporting an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (incremental costs divided by incremental effects). In this study the cost effectiveness analysis will provide information on the marginal costs and effects of the intervention relative to the alternative through the calculation of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios using the primary outcomes: blood pressure, total cholesterol, HBA1c and diabetes well-being. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will be calculated in all circumstances, except where equivalence in effect has been proven between intervention and control group [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50"><offsets xml_i="48971" xml_f="48973" txt_i="36478" txt_f="36480">50</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="48980" xml_f="48982" txt_i="36480" txt_f="36482">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48989" xml_f="50098" txt_i="36483" txt_f="37592">Costs are likely to fall on patients, their families and the state.

These costs will reflect the time input of health professionals and fixed or overhead costs, including any new equipment and capital expenditure. All contacts of patients with the health services will be recorded and valued, including general practice use, hospital attendances (both outpatient clinic and diabetes centre visits), admissions and drug prescriptions. Travel and time costs will also be calculated. The cost of the peer support system will be a major component of overall intervention costs. Estimates will be made of the work and leisure time foregone by peer support workers and monetary valuations will be estimated as part of the opportunity cost methodology. Training costs will also be measured and valued.

An alternative approach such as peer support may improve these outcomes. This approach is based on a social support theoretical framework rather than an educational or psychological framework and the outcomes we have selected for the study reflect this underlying theoretical framework. The potential advantage of peer support is that it focuses on the impact of the illness on daily life rather than on medical information about illness. The group meeting components of the intervention in this study are designed to build on the lay element of peer support through the encouragement of the sharing of experiences and exchanges between participants.
