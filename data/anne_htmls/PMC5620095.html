The standard methods of reconstruction are gastroduodenostomy, also termed Billroth-I (B-I) reconstruction, and gastrojejunostomy, also termed Billroth-II (B-II) reconstruction, both of which involve a single anastomosis.

However, the major disadvantage of B-I reconstruction is the reflux gastritis caused by the loss of the pylorus, which is the anatomical barrier preventing the reflux of bile into the stomach, and the reflux of bile eventually increases the risk of cancer in the remnant stomach [</offsets><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8555" xml_f="8556" txt_i="2756" txt_f="2757">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8563" xml_f="8696" txt_i="2757" txt_f="2890">].

The need for these complicated procedures has emerged as a major disadvantage of the R-Y reconstruction method. Several clinical studies have shown that R-Y reconstruction takes more time and has a higher complication rate than other methods [</offsets><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9673" xml_f="9674" txt_i="3678" txt_f="3679">9</offsets></xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9713" xml_f="9715" txt_i="3679" txt_f="3681">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9722" xml_f="10010" txt_i="3681" txt_f="3969">].

However, to recommend this procedure as a novel method instead of conventional reconstruction method, a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) was necessary to show the superiority of this method to the B-I method with respect to prevention of bile reflux into the remnant stomach and the safety of this procedure. To assess the effect of R-Y reconstruction on bile reflux as objectively as possible, we used three types of measurements, namely the results of histological examination, gastroscopic findings, and the quality of life of enrolled patients.

Moreover, our postoperative endoscopic and histologic findings showed the superiority of the R-Y reconstruction method in preventing the bile reflux into the remnant stomach.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="61565" xml_f="62185" txt_i="19618" txt_f="20238">In this RCT, we introduced a novel method of using only staplers to make the relatively complicated R-Y procedure after distal gastrectomy as easy as the conventional B-I or B-II method. Currently, many surgeons are using staplers for performing anastomoses because they are safe and time saving; these advanced instruments facilitated the novel procedure in this study as well. To date, several studies have shown that using advanced stapling devices reduces the incidence of complications, such as leakage and bleeding; in addition, stapling makes anastomosis of the intestine easier and more secure than hand sewing [</offsets><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="62217" xml_f="62219" txt_i="20238" txt_f="20240">16</offsets></xref><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="62258" xml_f="62260" txt_i="20240" txt_f="20242">17</offsets></xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="62299" xml_f="62301" txt_i="20242" txt_f="20244">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="62308" xml_f="63578" txt_i="20244" txt_f="21514">]. The advantage of using a stapling device is particularly evident in complicated procedures, such as the conventional R-Y reconstruction that requires many anastomoses. Because we used circular staplers for performing 2 anastomoses, we found it difficult to combine the anvils and the body of the staplers without an additional enterotomy. To overcome this problem, the body of a 21-mm stapler for the jejunojejunostomy was first inserted through the distal opening of the resected jejunum, and it was passed through 30–40 cm of the jejunum to combine it with the anvil fixed to the proximal end of the resected jejunum. Subsequently, the body of a 29-mm stapler for the gastrojejunostomy was inserted through the resected part of the stomach to combine it with the anvil inserted into the distal end of the resected jejunum; this procedure was not difficult because it was similar to the Tonado method for B-I reconstruction. Since additional hand sewn sutures for anastomosis were not required, the total operation time was not significantly longer than that for the B-I method that requires only one anastomosis. In addition, the operation time for patients from the R-Y group in this study was shorter than that observed in R-Y reconstruction in previous reports [</offsets><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="63609" xml_f="63610" txt_i="21514" txt_f="21515">7</offsets></xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="63649" xml_f="63651" txt_i="21515" txt_f="21517">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="63658" xml_f="63887" txt_i="21517" txt_f="21746">].

Bile reflux into the remnant stomach after distal gastrectomy is usually detected by 24-hour bilirubin monitoring or biliary scintigraphy [</offsets><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="64294" xml_f="64295" txt_i="22116" txt_f="22117">8</offsets></xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="64334" xml_f="64336" txt_i="22117" txt_f="22119">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="64343" xml_f="64781" txt_i="22119" txt_f="22557">]. However, we used endoscopic and histological findings, because these findings would directly reflect the damage to the mucosal layer of the remnant stomach from the refluxed bile. Although different anastomotic procedures have been used in other studies, R-Y reconstruction has been shown to have improved gastroscopic and histological findings in the remnant stomach after distal gastrectomy compared with B-I or B-II reconstruction [</offsets><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="64813" xml_f="64815" txt_i="22557" txt_f="22559">20</offsets></xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="64854" xml_f="64856" txt_i="22559" txt_f="22561">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="64863" xml_f="65171" txt_i="22561" txt_f="22869">]. To maintain objectivity in the evaluation of bile reflux into the remnant stomach in this RCT, the gastroscopic findings were examined by both a gastroenterologist and a surgeon.

This syndrome is characterized by epigastric discomfort and even pain after consuming food. This drawback cannot be addressed by our procedure using staplers because the problem is caused by the poor motility of the Roux limb after division of the jejunal mesentery. Therefore, we advised the patients of both groups to consume a small amount of food at a time during the immediate postoperative three months. Ultimately, the gastroscopic findings for food stasis did not show significant differences between the B-I and R-Y groups, and no patient from the R-Y group complained of symptoms related to Roux stasis syndrome. On the other hand, three patients from the R-Y group were treated for postoperative ileus as opposed to only one patient in the B-I group.

This questionnaire helps researchers to analyze the physical, psychological, and social views of patients with cancer. However, more specialized questionnaires are necessary to examine the quality of life of patients after gastrectomy; therefore, we also used the EORTC QLQ-STO22 questionnaire that has several questions about gastrointestinal symptoms.
