After the above mentioned three sessions, through two further telephone conversations, mothers were given some tips about doing Kegel exercises and mothers were encouraged to do exercises 2-3 times a day and their potential questions were answered. The final evaluation was done by recompleting questionnaire 1-month after training in both groups. Information about the actual method of delivery was collected by calling mothers in both groups.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title><offsets xml_i="16589" xml_f="16609" txt_i="11209" txt_f="11229">Statistical analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16620" xml_f="16812" txt_i="11230" txt_f="11422">Data analysis was performed using SPSS 16 Software (Chicago, SPSS Inc.) by using descriptive statistics (mean, frequency and standard deviation) and inferential statistics such as independent </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16820" xml_f="16821" txt_i="11422" txt_f="11423">t</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16830" xml_f="16844" txt_i="11423" txt_f="11437">-test, paired </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16852" xml_f="16853" txt_i="11437" txt_f="11438">t</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16862" xml_f="16904" txt_i="11438" txt_f="11480">-test, Chi-square and Mann–Whitney tests. </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="16912" xml_f="16913" txt_i="11480" txt_f="11481">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="16922" xml_f="16977" txt_i="11481" txt_f="11533"> &lt; 0.05 was considered as the level of significance.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title><offsets xml_i="17036" xml_f="17043" txt_i="11536" txt_f="11543">RESULTS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17054" xml_f="17168" txt_i="11544" txt_f="11658">The mean age of mothers were 26.72 ± 4.61 and 27.72 ± 5.81 year in intervention and control groups, respectively [</offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="17200" xml_f="17207" txt_i="11658" txt_f="11665">Table 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17214" xml_f="17518" txt_i="11665" txt_f="11969">].
