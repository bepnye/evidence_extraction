according to the contraction intensity of the masticatory muscle during deep cervical
flexor training. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty healthy adults were randomly selected and
the thicknesses of their longus colli and sternocleidomastoid were measured with
ultrasound when the masticatory muscle contracted during deep cervical flexor training.
[Results] The thickness of the longus colli tended to increase in proportion to the
contraction intensity of the masticatory muscle, with a significant difference. However,
the thickness of the sternocleidomastoid did not significantly differ with the contraction
intensity of the masticatory muscle. [Conclusion] During deep cervical flexor training,
when co-contraction of the masticatory muscle occures, changes in the thickness of the
longus colli may be selectively increased. Deep cervical flexor training was most
effective during contractions of a submaximal intensity.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Contraction intensity of masticatory muscle</kwd><kwd>Deep cervical flexor training</kwd><kwd>Thickness of neck flexors</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="4611" xml_f="4623" txt_i="1027" txt_f="1039">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4634" xml_f="4859" txt_i="1040" txt_f="1265">The longus colli and longus capitus are representative deep cervical flexors.

Here, chin-in motion
affects the contraction of the muscles connecting the mandible and cervical area. For
example, elevation (mouth closed) of the mandible triggers a contraction of the cervical
flexor, while depression (mouth open) of the mandible brings about a contraction of the
cervical extensor</offsets><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="5945" xml_f="5946" txt_i="2069" txt_f="2070">6</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="5958" xml_f="5959" txt_i="2070" txt_f="2071">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="5965" xml_f="6256" txt_i="2071" txt_f="2362">. In addition, the
masticatory muscle attached to the mandible plays the role of propioceptor, as well as
performing the functions of mastication, and therefore is involved in conducts postural
control of the head, cervical area, and upper limb in co-ordination with the deep cervical
flexor</offsets><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6287" xml_f="6288" txt_i="2362" txt_f="2363">7</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="6300" xml_f="6301" txt_i="2363" txt_f="2364">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="6307" xml_f="6652" txt_i="2364" txt_f="2709">. Previous research has reported
that during the motion of clenching, the direction and intensity of mastication resulted in
significantly different activations of the cervical muscles. One study stated that changes
in the location of the lower jaw, such as opening or clenching the mouth, lead to
significant differences in the cervical muscles</offsets><xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6683" xml_f="6684" txt_i="2709" txt_f="2710">8</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="6696" xml_f="6697" txt_i="2710" txt_f="2711">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="6703" xml_f="7050" txt_i="2711" txt_f="3058">. This is because the fascia covering the masticatory muscle has
continuity with the fascia of the cervical muscles and has the same functional unit;
therefore, it affects the activity of the cervical muscles, and the contraction of the
masticatory muscle in coordination with the cervical muscles increases the contraction of
the cervical muscles</offsets><xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7081" xml_f="7082" txt_i="3058" txt_f="3059">9</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="7094" xml_f="7095" txt_i="3059" txt_f="3060">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="7101" xml_f="7546" txt_i="3060" txt_f="3505">. In previous
research, changes in the thickness of the deep cervical flexor were observed when clenching
at a submaximal intensity, but the degree of coordination of the cervical flexor will become
different according to the contraction intensity of the masticatory muscle. Therefore, this
study compared the thickness of the cervical flexor according to the contraction intensity
of the masticatory muscle during deep cervical flexor training.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title><offsets xml_i="7595" xml_f="7615" txt_i="3507" txt_f="3527">SUBJECTS AND METHODS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7626" xml_f="9534" txt_i="3528" txt_f="5436">This study recruited 20 healthy adults who voluntarily consented to participate in this
study and signed a written consent. This experiment was approved by the Bioethics Committee
of the Catholic University of Pusan. The subjects were those who had no neck pain,
temporomandibular joint pain, or headache within the last six months. During the
familiarization session, the subjects were taught how to perform deep cervical flexor
training, and maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the masseter was measured;
then, clenching was performed at 10, 50, and 80% MVIC. The clenching intensity was adjusted
by the subjects who were given feedback of the root mean squares values of the
electromyography trace on a monitor (Myo-System DTS, Noraxon U.S.A. Inc., Scottsdale, CA,
USA). In this experiment, the subjects lay in a supine position on a bed. First, a pressure
biofeedback unit was placed on the cervical posterior surface of the subjects and the
posterior surface of the neck was pressured to 20 mmHg with the pressure biofeedback unit.
The subjects then performed chin-in with the mouth lightly closed without contraction of the
masticatory muscle. In this position, the experimenter measured the thicknesses of the
longus colli and sternocleidomastoid of each subject with ultrasound. Then, both masseters
of the subjects were cleaned with alcohol cotton and dried. Ag-AgCl electrodes were attached
to the subjects who were then instructed to conduct chin-in in the same way, while
simultaneously clenching the masseter muscle at intensities of 10, 50, and 80% MVIC. The
ultrasound measurement location was 2 cm downward from the thyroid cartilage. The area was
marked with a marker and the measurement was taken with the ultrasound transducer placed at
a right angle, 1 cm from the right side. The longest front and rear distances among the
images of the muscular cross-section were measured</offsets><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9566" xml_f="9568" txt_i="5436" txt_f="5438">10</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="9580" xml_f="9581" txt_i="5438" txt_f="5439">)</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="9587" xml_f="10410" txt_i="5439" txt_f="6262">. Each motion was measured three times and the average value was
used for the analysis. To prevent damage to the subjects’ teeth and temporomandibular
joints, the subjects conducted clenching with a mouthpiece placed in the mouth. To prevent
muscle fatigue, each motion was maintained for 5 s and 2 min of resting time was given.
Ultrasound (SONOACE X4, MEDISON, Seoul, South Korea) was measured using a 7.5 MHz linear
transducer in B-Mode. SPSS 19.0 was used for the statistical analysis. Descriptive
statistics of the subjects’ general characteristics were calculated and repeated measures
analysis of variance was used to examine changes in the thicknesses of the longus colli and
sternocleidomastoid according to the contraction intensity of the subjects’ masticatory
muscles. A significance level of α = 0.05 was used.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title><offsets xml_i="10459" xml_f="10466" txt_i="6264" txt_f="6271">RESULTS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10477" xml_f="10534" txt_i="6272" txt_f="6329">The general characteristics of the subjects are shown in </offsets><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table"><offsets xml_i="10571" xml_f="10578" txt_i="6329" txt_f="6336">Table 1</offsets></xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="10657" xml_f="10665" txt_i="6336" txt_f="6344">Table 1.</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="10689" xml_f="10727" txt_i="6344" txt_f="6382">Characteristics of the subjects (N=20)</offsets></title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="10836" xml_f="10845" txt_i="6383" txt_f="6392">Variables</offsets></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="10893" xml_f="10898" txt_i="6392" txt_f="6397">Value</offsets></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="10968" xml_f="10980" txt_i="6397" txt_f="6409">Gender (M/F)</offsets></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="11028" xml_f="11032" txt_i="6410" txt_f="6414">15/5</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="11087" xml_f="11096" txt_i="6415" txt_f="6424">Age (yrs)</offsets></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="11144" xml_f="11154" txt_i="6425" txt_f="6435">21.4 (1.8)</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="11209" xml_f="11220" txt_i="6436" txt_f="6447">Height (cm)</offsets></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="11268" xml_f="11279" txt_i="6448" txt_f="6459">172.7 (4.4)</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="11334" xml_f="11345" txt_i="6460" txt_f="6471">Weight (kg)</offsets></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="11393" xml_f="11404" txt_i="6472" txt_f="6483">68.8 (7.76)</offsets></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><offsets xml_i="11443" xml_f="11444" txt_i="6484" txt_f="6485">.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11451" xml_f="11884" txt_i="6486" txt_f="6913">The thickness of the longus colli tended to increase in proportion to the contraction

masticatory muscle was concurrently contracted at intensities of 10% and 50% MVIC was
because the weak muscle contraction failed to reach the threshold triggering coordination
with the cervical muscles. Thus, when the masticatory muscle is co-contracted at a
submaximal intensity, it would be more effective at strengthening the deep cervical flexor.
A future study should investigate the effect in patients with chronic neck pain, because the
subjects of this study were normal adults.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Evcik</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Aksoy</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Correlation of temporomandibular joint pathologies, neck
