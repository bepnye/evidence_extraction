Future research on this topic should also include a greater proportion of minority participants. This cross-sectional analysis includes only one test of convergent validity; future longitudinal studies should evaluate the predictive validity of these measures by assessing their association with clinical outcomes, such as glycemic control over time, to better inform our understanding of the psychometric properties of these scales in minority groups. Several other numeracy and health literacy measures have been developed, but the PRIDE study only administered two examples of each. We might have observed different results if we had used different measures for each trait and method assessed in this study.
