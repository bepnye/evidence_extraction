Each user has a personal username and password and completes an online tutorial about how to use the system. QC is based on the generic use of search filters specifically designed around the information needs of general practitioners (GP). Five types of search filters or "profiles" are available (disease aetiology, diagnosis, treatment, prescribing and patient education). Up to four keywords can be used to describe a clinical question. Clinicians search for information firstly by selecting a search filter to match their question type (e.g. diagnosis, treatment etc.) and then entering keywords to describe the query. For example, a clinician who encounters a 32-year old woman with a fourth presentation of pelvic pain in the last 6 months with ultrasound and swabs for infection all negative, may have a question regarding the social, psychological as well as biological causes of pelvic pain. The clinician could select the 'etiology' profile and enter 'pelvic pain', 'pathology' and 'psychosocial' as keywords (Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="11101" xml_f="11102" txt_i="6658" txt_f="6659">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11109" xml_f="11529" txt_i="6659" txt_f="7079">). The search filters retrieve evidence from resources including Therapeutic Guidelines (a summarised evidence resource developed by Australian experts); the Merck Manual; Health Insite (a government funded health database); PubMed; MIMS (a pharmaceutical database); and a collection of relevant Australian guidelines identified by a panel of clinical experts. Users can also search each of these resources individually.</offsets></p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label><offsets xml_i="11570" xml_f="11578" txt_i="7080" txt_f="7088">Figure 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="11598" xml_f="11628" txt_i="7088" txt_f="7118">Quick Clinical user interface.</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6947-6-33-1"></graphic></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label><offsets xml_i="11734" xml_f="11742" txt_i="7119" txt_f="7127">Figure 2</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="11762" xml_f="11824" txt_i="7127" txt_f="7189">Screenshot of online feedback facility (questions after [16]).</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6947-6-33-2"></graphic></fig></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11911" xml_f="11919" txt_i="7191" txt_f="7199">Outcomes</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11930" xml_f="12244" txt_i="7200" txt_f="7514">The primary outcome measures are clinician acceptance and use of QC and the resulting change in decision-making behaviour.
