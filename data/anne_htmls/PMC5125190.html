Assessment included standard questions asked to the patients about the comfort of the injection, verbal response and behavioural signs (such as facial grimacing, arm withdrawal or tears from the eyes). Pain was graded using a four-point scale: 0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain (pain reported only in response to questioning without any behavioural signs), 2 = moderate pain (pain reported in response to questioning and accompanied by a behavioural sign or pain reported spontaneously without questioning) and 3 = severe pain (i.e. strong vocal response or response accompanied by facial grimacing, arm withdrawal or tears).[</offsets><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9647" xml_f="9648" txt_i="5330" txt_f="5331">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9655" xml_f="9656" txt_i="5331" txt_f="5332">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9663" xml_f="10074" txt_i="5333" txt_f="5744">Anaesthesia induction was continued with fentanyl 3–5 μg/kg and midazolam 0.03 mg/kg intravenously.
