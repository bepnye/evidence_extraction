A preliminary study (unpublished, 2004/05, Wandsworth UK, Local Research Ethics Committee 03.0102) has demonstrated that stroke survivors can: a) pedal the modified exercise cycle for up to ten minutes with no adverse effects, and b) tolerate the different positions of the right and left pedals. Participants were included in this observational study if they were at least 14 days after stroke onset, able to sit without support for one minute, able to follow a one-stage command, previously independently mobile but now unable to mobilise and having no other limiting disease process or pathology.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="14790" xml_f="14851" txt_i="9467" txt_f="9528">Potential prognostic indicators for therapeutic interventions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="14862" xml_f="15138" txt_i="9529" txt_f="9805">Therapists use a wide range of clinical interventions in their repertoire but there is little research evidence to guide clinical decisions on which patients are likely to respond to which therapies.

This information has the potential to inform the design of future research and provide indicators to clinicians about which patients might best take part in which activities. The current trial will record four potential prognostic indicators-site of lesion, trunk control, paretic leg motor function and walking ability-before participants attempt to use the equipment; links to the ability to pedal the pedalling activity will be analysed and contribute to clinical conclusions and inform future research. For this novel aspect of the study, selection of potential indicators was based on those factors previously demonstrated to correlate to functional outcomes after stroke.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44900" xml_f="45011" txt_i="36520" txt_f="36631">Some exploratory studies have investigated the potential clinical efficacy of pedalling exercise after stroke [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="45043" xml_f="45045" txt_i="36631" txt_f="36633">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45052" xml_f="45053" txt_i="36633" txt_f="36634">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"><offsets xml_i="45085" xml_f="45087" txt_i="36634" txt_f="36636">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45094" xml_f="45095" txt_i="36636" txt_f="36637">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"><offsets xml_i="45127" xml_f="45129" txt_i="36637" txt_f="36639">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45136" xml_f="45694" txt_i="36639" txt_f="37197">] but the early findings of our systematic review (in progress) suggest that no trial has evaluated upright pedalling in a group of stroke survivors within one month of stroke onset. The potential challenges that early stroke survivors might face in taking part in this activity, such as safely sitting in an upright posture and taking part in repetitive exercise, have been addressed: firstly by using a modified exercise cycle, and secondly, by ensuring that physiological parameters and evidence of fatigue are monitored and recorded by the research team.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45701" xml_f="46172" txt_i="37198" txt_f="37669">It is possible that our results might indicate none of the prognostic indicators are linked to the ability to pedal, and/or clinical efficacy of the intervention is not demonstrated. If this is the case, the risk of wasting valuable research resources on larger-scale trials, using the current indicators and measures, is minimised.

EMG data from quadriceps and hamstrings will be recorded at baseline and outcome as well as at each pedalling session, providing evidence of any change at a biological level that might contribute to, and underpin, possible changes in functional measures. Using sessional EMG recordings will also allow analysis of whether pedalling is being achieved by the unaffected leg propelling the crank i.e with the use of compensatory strategies, or whether there are changes in recordable activity in the affected leg suggestive of recovery.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46885" xml_f="47210" txt_i="38370" txt_f="38695">The control group will undergo conventional therapy only, and this will be quantified on a standardised treatment schedule, allowing for comparisons of amount and type of therapy across trial arms.
