Low birth weight was defined as birth weight &lt;2500 g. Classification of type of antenatal ART was on the basis of the most potent therapy received. ART was classified as monotherapy if a single nucleoside was administered at a time, as dual therapy if any two nucleosides were administered and as HAART if a protease inhibitor plus two other drugs (excluding NNRTIs as this was an exclusion criteria for the trial) were administered. Undetectable viral load was defined as having HIV RNA levels below 400 copies/ml.

Very similar proportions in the two settings had HIV RNA levels below 400 copies/ml at study entry; however, by the time of delivery there was a significant difference between geographic areas, with fewer women in the US having HIV RNA below 400 copies/ml and an overall higher median in the US versus Europe. In a sub-analysis of the 259 women from European and the 539 women from USA sites who had been diagnosed with HIV infection prior to their current pregnancy, almost identical proportions (182/259, 70% and 357/539, 66%) were already receiving ART at enrolment. Among the 606 women in the USA who started ART in pregnancy, the median gestational age at initiation was 18 weeks (range, 14–25 weeks), substantially earlier than the median of 27 weeks (range 18–32)

This reflects the growing uncertainty from this time of the added benefit of elective caesarean delivery for women with undetectable plasma HIV RNA loads, and specifically concerns that the potential benefits in terms of reduced MTCT risk may be outweighed by the costs, such as the increased risk of post-partum complications and greater burden on health care services associated with elective caesarean delivery. This lack of consensus has continued in the absence of a definitive answer, with current policy and practice regarding mode of delivery varying considerably across Europe, although an increasing number of policies now recommend offering a vaginal delivery to women on successful HAART with undetectable viral load [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41"><offsets xml_i="46446" xml_f="46448" txt_i="25863" txt_f="25865">41</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46455" xml_f="46457" txt_i="25865" txt_f="25867">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46464" xml_f="46615" txt_i="25868" txt_f="26019">Concerns exist regarding the generalizability of results from HIV clinical trials, particularly those with stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42"><offsets xml_i="46647" xml_f="46649" txt_i="26019" txt_f="26021">42</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46656" xml_f="46657" txt_i="26021" txt_f="26022">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44"><offsets xml_i="46689" xml_f="46691" txt_i="26022" txt_f="26024">44</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46698" xml_f="46895" txt_i="26024" txt_f="26221">].

Although the therapeutic management of pregnant HIV-infected women is now more uniform between the continents, with the predominance of HAART initiated from before or during pregnancy, significant population differences are likely to remain.
