We tested differences between groups in chi-squared tests for the former and Kruskal-Wallis tests for the latter, for which we report medians. The latter statistical test was chosen in light of the observed gross non-normality with some participants spending very little time with the pages open and others spending more time reading.

Secondly, the low overall levels of accessing this further information warrant consideration as does the low level of receipt of any debriefing information provided on a website (for Group B) rather than in the body of an email (as for Group A).

Strictly speaking, our time spent on each page measure is of how long the page is open. It is likely that not all of this time was spent actually reading text if other distractions occurred; however, this should have been equally likely in both groups. A clear strength of the data reported here is that they are not reliant on self-report and subject to reporting biases, as they are objectively ascertained, both in relation to whether links were clicked and how long the pages were open. We did not measure email reading time, simply because we could not. One-time-only links to web pages were provided to ensure that participants were not counted twice.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23766" xml_f="24161" txt_i="14525" txt_f="14920">It is possible that many more participants read at least some of the debriefing information in the Group A email and were satisfied with this, or otherwise decided that they did not want further information.

Alternatively, a key purpose of debriefing is to discover and act upon any harms identified. The reactions of those who have been subjected to any form of deception in research are important to consider in ethical evaluations. For example, according to the British Psychological Society, “If this led to discomfort, anger or objections from the participants then the deception was inappropriate”[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11"><offsets xml_i="24735" xml_f="24737" txt_i="15419" txt_f="15421">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24744" xml_f="25337" txt_i="15421" txt_f="16014">]. This was our primary research interest and why we believe that our outcome measures were well chosen: If research participants have concerns raised by online debriefing information, accessing further information is likely to be the first step in addressing these concerns, if it is made easily available. Where the uptake of more detailed information on study design, methods, and findings is deemed important, as may often be the case in studies involving deception, it appears that basic debriefing information could be better provided via a link and not included in the body of an email.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25344" xml_f="26023" txt_i="16015" txt_f="16694">The low levels of access of the basic debriefing information in Group B remain, however, a matter of substantial concern, and they restrict the confidence that one may draw from the effects favoring Group B. Approximately three-quarters of these participants have received no debriefing information at all, and this appears to be a much bigger problem than we would have expected. If debriefing is worth doing, then it should be done as well as possible, in line with the motivating aims of the present study. This is true even in the absence of harms as they are usually conceived, in order to provide moral accountability for the infringement of the right to informed consent [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12"><offsets xml_i="26057" xml_f="26059" txt_i="16694" txt_f="16696">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="26066" xml_f="26167" txt_i="16696" txt_f="16797">].

Instead, we checked with the Ethics Committee and with the universities involved and confirmed that they had received no complaints from students concerning any aspect of the research. It is therefore not so straightforward to put the two sets of findings together and determine the most appropriate course of action on debriefing. There is merit in further investigating the uptake rates of any debriefing information observed here for Group B, which have the advantage of reliable measurement. If the present findings are confirmed, on balance, we would judge these uptake rates to be unacceptably low and may prefer instead to include the debriefing information in the body of the email, but we have no means of knowing to what extent there is any engagement with information provided there. Time spent reading the protocol was low. It appears it was largely inspected for a few seconds and then the page closed. The results summary was designed to be brief and can be fully read in around the median time spent with the page open. We cannot know, however, how deeply this information was processed or whether the issues involved were more than superficially considered. Longer reading time would be more encouraging in this regard.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27899" xml_f="28574" txt_i="18471" txt_f="19146">Ethical scrutiny of our own practice is made stronger by the kind of data reported here. Study participants were not exposed to risks or harms beyond the infringement of their rights to informed consent, which we acknowledge is a profound harm in itself. Can we make any assumptions about those who did not read the debriefing information? We believe that we cannot, as it would seem unwise to consider either that they may be unconcerned about the infringement of their right to informed consent as research participants, or alternatively that they would be greatly concerned. There are few previous studies providing helpful data in this regard, though Fisher and Fyrberg [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9"><offsets xml_i="28607" xml_f="28608" txt_i="19146" txt_f="19147">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="28615" xml_f="28971" txt_i="19147" txt_f="19503">] identified approximately 70% of university student participants as having a basically utilitarian attitude to infringements of such rights in research and approximately 30% who may be offended, among whom a much smaller proportion were deeply offended. These harms need to be balanced against the research and hence the social value of the data obtained.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28978" xml_f="30141" txt_i="19504" txt_f="20667">In our ethical deliberations on this type of research, we were concerned that debriefing itself may constitute a source of harm by revealing an infringement of rights not previously known. The data in the present study are helpful to ongoing consideration of whether debriefing should be undertaken, as well as how. We found no evidence in this particular study that debriefing itself may be harmful and therefore no reason to discontinue it, although consideration of the cumulative impact of such debriefing, in populations such as students who are regularly invited to participate in research, as well as the use of deception in research more broadly, is warranted. For example, it is entirely possible that those who have been debriefed may be more cautious about participating in future research studies, which would diminish the value of the data obtained in those studies. This type of harm is both important and challenging to evaluate. Empirical data are of course no substitute for ethical reflection; however, they can also undoubtedly enrich it. The paucity of empirical data in relation to ethical decision-making has previously been commented upon [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16"><offsets xml_i="30175" xml_f="30177" txt_i="20667" txt_f="20669">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30184" xml_f="30393" txt_i="20669" txt_f="20878">]. We very much agree there is a wider need for high quality empirical studies, using experimental data in particular, to inform ethical evaluations of future methodological developments, online and elsewhere.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p> The research was funded via an Australian Research Council Discovery Project Grant (DP1093809) and by a Wellcome Trust Research Career Development award in Basic Biomedical Science (WT086516MA) to the first author.
