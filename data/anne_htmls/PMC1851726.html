Many groups of researchers around the world are developing candidate vaccines of different types that it is hoped would protect against malaria. One of these types is a “blood-stage” vaccine, which would prevent parasite multiplication in red blood cells. A candidate blood-stage vaccine is FMP1/AS02A, which is designed to raise an immune response against a particular protein (merozoite surface protein-1) on the surface of the blood-stage infectious form of the malaria parasite. In early-stage clinical trials performed in people not exposed to malaria (healthy volunteers in the United States) and in African adults who were exposed to malaria, this candidate vaccine has already been shown to be safe and to bring about an immune response. As part of the next stage in developing this vaccine, a group of researchers next wanted to see whether the vaccine was also safe and brought about an immune response in the population most in need of a vaccine: young children living in an African region with very intense malaria transmission. Therefore, as reported here, this group performed a small trial in western Kenya, recruiting 135 children under 5 y of age to receive either the FMP1/AS02A vaccine (at three different doses) or rabies vaccine for comparison (thus ensuring that children in the control arm got some benefit from being in the trial). The outcomes that the researchers were interested in were primarily adverse events, which they categorized using a standard questionnaire at up to 7 d after vaccination; unsolicited events reported up to 30 d after vaccination; and, finally, any serious events occurring up to 8 mo later. The researchers also examined antibody responses to the FMP1/AS02A vaccine.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12725" xml_f="12726" txt_i="4232" txt_f="4233">

Most participants reported unsolicited events during follow-up, but the proportion of participants with adverse events did not seem to be different between the FMP1/AS02A vaccine groups and the rabies vaccine group. Unsolicited outcomes that were reported included, for example, clinical malaria, upper respiratory tract infections, and a few events that were thought to be related to the vaccines, such as fever and eczema. A few serious adverse events occurred up to 8 mo after vaccination, but the numbers did not seem to be different between the FMP1/AS02A and rabies vaccine groups, and the events were not judged to be related to vaccination. Finally, participants who received the FMP1/AS02A vaccine raised an antibody response to the vaccine, which was highest in those who received the highest vaccine dose. The researchers concluded that this vaccine was safe and brought about an immune response in the group of malaria-exposed children studied.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13896" xml_f="13897" txt_i="5384" txt_f="5385">

Therefore, the data obtained from this study will be informative in helping to design future trials on FMP1/AS02A. The randomization procedures used in this study were appropriate, and in particular participants of different ages were equally distributed to the different intervention groups, helping to minimize bias. Procedures were also set up to prevent participants and staff giving the vaccines and collecting data from knowing which interventions participants had received. However, the number of participants recruited into the trial was small, and it therefore was not powered to detect anything other than large differences in rates of adverse events between the study groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14765" xml_f="14766" txt_i="6234" txt_f="6235">

The last mentioned was a nonpruritic skin rash developing in the right flank area about 50 min after a second vaccination of the 10-μg dose of FMP1/AS02A. Initially presenting with a plaque-like appearance, these lesions developed a follicular eczematous pattern that then resolved over a few days. This child had been noted to have similar (albeit smaller) dermatitic or eczematous lesions prior to the first vaccination. A third vaccination was withheld from this subject. One grade 3 unsolicited symptom occurred during the postimmunization follow-up period, a 25-μg FMP1/AS02A subject experiencing grade 3 malaria beginning 2 d after receiving the first vaccination. (Grade 3 was defined as an event severe enough to prevent normal daily activities.) No subject in the study experienced a grade 3 vaccine-related, unsolicited symptom.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s3e3"><title><offsets xml_i="47964" xml_f="47991" txt_i="33469" txt_f="33496">Serious and unexpected AEs.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48002" xml_f="48559" txt_i="33497" txt_f="34054">Serious and unexpected AEs were collected on a real-time basis through study day 240.

She developed hepatitis and severe anemia 7 d later. She died 62 d after her third vaccination, following several hospitalizations and blood transfusions. In this subject, an extravascular hemolysis caused severe organomegaly with secondary thrombocytopenia and hypersplenism, along with a possible partial obstruction of biliary outflow. The death of this subject led to a thorough review of the case by the principal investigator, the DSMB, and a pediatric hematology consultant not previously associated with the study. After considering all potential etiologies (including Epstein–Barr virus, parvovirus B19, and others) that could have precipitated such a clinical course and the clinical context (e.g., the long interval between vaccination and onset), it was concluded that there was not a likely causal biological connection between the immunization and the preterminal course and death. In accordance with the study protocol, the principal investigator's judgment was that “there are other, more likely causes and administration of the study vaccine is not suspected to have contributed to the adverse event.” Her death was judged not related to the study vaccine, but rather to autoimmune hemolytic anemia, most likely secondary to a viral infection, causing first hepatitis and then an unusual warm reactive immunoglobulin G.

<bold>Author Contributions</bold> MRW, BRO, JBM, KT, LAS, AL, JW, FD, SAR, and DGH designed the study. BRO, KT, JW, FD, SAR, WRB, and DGH analyzed the data.. MRW, DM, BRO, OJA, and OGA enrolled the subjects. MRW, DM, BRO, JNW, KT, LAS, CD, JW, FD, VAS, SAR, JC, WRB, JAL, EA, and DGH wrote the paper. MRW was the principal investigator and study site director. DM transcribed data from source documents to case report forms for data entry and assisted with AE determinations and participant eligibility determinations. JNW helped in analysis and interpretation of anti-FMP1 antibody data. JBM assisted in managing the conduct of the study. OJA was the lead clinical trials coordinator responsible for participant follow-up and for general compliance to protocol-related issues and oversaw the quality assurance and quality control process for the trial-related data. CD contributed as part of the study team to the design and implementation of the study through weekly teleconferences, review of the protocol, and provision of advice on implementation. SAR consulted on the study design and analysis and reviewed the first draft of the manuscript. VAS contributed to the design of the experiment and the writing of the human use protocol, and the serology was performed in her laboratory. As the head of GlaxoSmithKline's Program on Malaria Vaccine R&amp;D, JC participated in all phases of the work leading to the implementation of the clinical study described in this manuscript; read the manuscript, provided comments, and suggested modifications; and agreed with the results presented and their interpretation. CAH is the data manager and, as such, checked and confirmed all ELISA results. JAL invented the vaccine. EA performed evaluations of the FMP1 vaccine stability and measurements of vaccine potency in mice in support of the IND filing and protocol submission and throughout the period of the phase I safety study. (These studies are performed to ensure vaccine integrity. This work is ongoing and consists of tests performed at specified periods from the date of manufacture; these studies include mouse potency studies demonstrating comparable seroconversion throughout the course of the study, as well as SDS-PAGE and Western blotting to demonstrate antigen purity and profile.) JAS set up the initial preliminary investigations that made it possible for this study to take place. SKM reviewed, provided insight, and supervised the overall execution of the clinical trial. DGH conceived of the overall strategic framework—of which this study is one—in a deliberate progression from malaria-naïve to malaria-experienced subjects and from adults to children.</p></fn><fn id="n101" fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
<bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported by funds from the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH)'s Malaria Vaccine Initiative and the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC). We also acknowledge the perennial scientific and fiscal support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which has made possible the development, Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), and initial clinical evaluations of the FMP1 antigen and continues to allow its production. These funders participated in the study design and in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. They were also involved in the writing of the manuscript and in the decision to submit it for publication. The study sponsor (the Office of the Surgeon General, United States Army), through its Human Subjects Research Review Board (HSRRB), reviewed the study design, including collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. The HSRRB has not been involved in the writing of the manuscript or in the decision to submit it for publication. The corresponding author (who was the principal investigator) had complete access to all the data described in this manuscript.</p></fn><fn id="n102" fn-type="COI-statement"><p>
<bold>Competing Interests:</bold> EA and JAL have a patent application for the FMP1 malaria vaccine (patent number 6,855,322), and EA, JC, and JAL (along with Gerald Voss) have a patent application pending that was filed by United States Army (patent application number 20030161839). AL, WRB, and JC are employees of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, the manufacturer of AS02A; AL holds shares in the company; JC owns and holds options to shares in the company and is a named inventor on patents and/or patent applications in the field of malaria vaccines, although he is not a holder of any of these patents. FD and JBM were employees of PATH's Malaria Vaccine Initiative, which provided funding for this trial. DM's salary was 80% funded by the Malaria Vaccine Initiative. KT's employer, Statistics Collaborative, is employed by the Malaria Vaccine Initiative as statistical contractors. CD is employed as the senior technical advisor to the USAID's Malaria Vaccine Development Program and advised USAID to provide financial support to this study. JW received funding from the Malaria Vaccine Initiative for contributions to this trial. DGH is the Malaria Vaccine Program Director for the United States Army and acknowledges the monetary support to the Army Malaria Vaccine Program of the Malaria Vaccine Initiative at PATH, of the USAID, and of GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals for the development and clinical testing of the FMP1/AS02A vaccine described in this manuscript. As program director, the success or failure of the FMP1/AS02A vaccine does affect the future agreements and funding of this and of competing candidate vaccines, and DGH has no personal financial interest in this vaccine.</p><p> The views of the authors do not necessarily reflect the position of the Department of the Army or the Department of Defense of the United States.
