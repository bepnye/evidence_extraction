Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either infliximab (5 mg/kg intravenous infusion given over 2 h at baseline, and again at 2 weeks and 6 weeks after the first infusion) or ciclosporin (2 mg/kg per day by continuous infusion for up to 7 days, followed by twice-daily tablets delivering 5·5 mg/kg per day for 12 weeks). Randomisation used a web-based password-protected site, with a dynamic algorithm to generate allocations on request, thus protecting against investigator preference or other subversion, while ensuring that each trial group was balanced by centre, which was the only stratification used. Local investigators and participants were aware of the treatment allocated, but the chief investigator and analysts were masked. Analysis was by treatment allocated. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted survival—ie, the area under the curve (AUC) of scores from the Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Questionnaire (CUCQ) completed by participants at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, then every 6 months from 1 year to 3 years.

Local investigators were aware of treatment allocations, but the chief investigator and analysts remained masked to allocations until the trial steering and data monitoring committees had approved the analysis of the primary outcome. The protocol mandated either three infusions of infliximab over 6 weeks, or intravenous ciclosporin for up to 7 days, followed by oral administration for 12 weeks. After this, principal investigators were given discretion to continue or stop treatment. In keeping with current practice, infliximab tended to be used for longer than ciclosporin. Although increased treatment duration might have improved the effectiveness of infliximab, it certainly increased costs. Treatment with immunosuppressants during and after infliximab or ciclosporin was similar in both groups. Neither the rate nor timing of colectomy differed between allocated groups. Importantly, post-colectomy quality-of-life scores and interviews with participants who had undergone surgery both suggest that colectomy is not a bad outcome. There is evidence from observational studies that the cumulative rate of colectomy increases over time, not only with ciclosporin, but also with infliximab.</offsets><xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36019" xml_f="36021" txt_i="25939" txt_f="25941">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36028" xml_f="36030" txt_i="25941" txt_f="25943">, </offsets><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36064" xml_f="36066" txt_i="25943" txt_f="25945">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36073" xml_f="36075" txt_i="25945" txt_f="25947">, </offsets><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36109" xml_f="36111" txt_i="25947" txt_f="25949">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36118" xml_f="36120" txt_i="25949" txt_f="25951">, </offsets><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36154" xml_f="36156" txt_i="25951" txt_f="25953">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36163" xml_f="36165" txt_i="25953" txt_f="25955">, </offsets><xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36199" xml_f="36201" txt_i="25955" txt_f="25957">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36208" xml_f="36210" txt_i="25957" txt_f="25959">, </offsets><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36244" xml_f="36246" txt_i="25959" txt_f="25961">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36253" xml_f="36255" txt_i="25961" txt_f="25963">, </offsets><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="36289" xml_f="36291" txt_i="25963" txt_f="25965">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36298" xml_f="36543" txt_i="25965" txt_f="26210"> Hence, we plan to follow the trial and cohort participants for 10 years from recruitment, using routine National Health Service data to monitor readmissions and colectomies, with annual questionnaires to monitor trial patients' quality of life.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36550" xml_f="36771" txt_i="26211" txt_f="26432">To measure effectiveness from a patient perspective we used the CUCQ, a 32 item questionnaire with an additional ten questions for patients with a stoma.

There were therefore two malignancies in the infliximab group (the basal cell carcinoma and colorectal cancer), and one in the ciclosporin group (endometrial cancer). The colorectal cancer in the infliximab group was unusual in that it had some histological features suggestive of a lung primary. The local multidisciplinary team considered the case carefully and concluded that this was a single colorectal primary.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
