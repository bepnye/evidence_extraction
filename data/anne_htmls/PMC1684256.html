Randomization was done in blocks of 15. After randomization, letters were sent to participants to inform them of group status. Weight loss protocols were derived from prior weight loss studies by members of the Weigh-to-Be research team and designed as potentially cost-effective delivery modes for weight loss within an MCO population. Intervention consisted of 10 self-paced modules that promoted behavioral goal setting and self-monitoring, decreases in caloric intake, and increases in physical activity. Intervention content was designed for delivery by mail (written materials and regular mailings from trained staff to monitor treatment progress) or by telephone (same written materials as mail-based intervention, with the substitution of regular telephone contacts with trained staff to monitor treatment progress). Participants assigned to the usual care group were not offered weight intervention beyond that available through the MCO health plan. At the time of the study, the MCO health plan was offering telephone-based weight counseling, clinic-based advice on selecting a weight control program in the community, and clinic-based group programs provided by health plan staff, both for a $25 fee.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11410" xml_f="11629" txt_i="6788" txt_f="7007">Data were collected from 508 men and 1293 women at baseline, and from 295 men and 705 women at 24-month follow-up (56% of baseline sample).

In every case, however, reductions in consumption of these specific foods over time, and overall reductions in fat intake, were associated with better BMI outcomes for both men and women. It is likely that these high-fat foods are readily identified targets for intake modification among high consumers who engage in a weight loss program, thus leading to an association of baseline consumption with BMI reduction over time. Whereas effect size indicators suggest that changes in composite indices of fat or fiber intake were stronger predictors of BMI change that individual foods, changes in intake of some individual foods predicted BMI change as well as composite measures (e.g., French fries or fruit for men; margarine, vegetables, or cereal for women). It is likely that these foods, which may be identified easily as sources of fat or dietary fiber, also became obvious targets for reduced or increased consumption within the context of a dietary change plan, as advocated in the weight loss program in which study participants were enrolled.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43408" xml_f="43686" txt_i="25375" txt_f="25653">It should be noted that in the Weigh-to-Be trial, participation in weight loss activities was high even in the usual care group, such that the three groups (usual care, mail intervention, and phone intervention) did not differ in terms of weight change at the 2-year follow-up [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="43718" xml_f="43720" txt_i="25653" txt_f="25655">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43727" xml_f="44003" txt_i="25655" txt_f="25931">].
