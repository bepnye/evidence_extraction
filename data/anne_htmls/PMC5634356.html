After integrating the remaining criteria, 50 patients were qualified to participate in this study. From the mentioned patients, 14 patients were excluded since they lost their dressing earlier than 7 days or did not show up for removal of dressing on the seventh day. Thus, statistical analysis was performed for 36 patients.
