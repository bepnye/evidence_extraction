Reliability of the tool was confirmed by split-half method in a pilot study on 30 subjects (not attending the study) and through calculation of Cronbach's alpha for questions on knowledge (α =0.83) and attitude (α =0.76).</offsets></p><sec id="sec2-1"><title><offsets xml_i="15017" xml_f="15039" txt_i="9426" txt_f="9448">Ethical considerations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="15050" xml_f="15253" txt_i="9449" txt_f="9652">The subjects were explained about the design of research, method of education, and confidentiality of their data as well as the goal of study, and were asked to sign a written consent to enter the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15260" xml_f="15433" txt_i="9653" txt_f="9826">The subjects in each group were invited to attend the educational workshop.

The control group received conventional and routine education during maternal care by the midwives in health care centers, gynecologists, and their other relatives. Stages one to four of the questionnaire complement for the subjects in the study groups were conducted before intervention at the beginning of the first educational workshop session and after intervention at the end of the last educational workshop session, 1 month after intervention, and 6 weeks after delivery, respectively. After the delivery stage, the details of delivery mode were asked and recorded in the questionnaire. All these four stages were conducted for the control group in the same time intervals. Questionnaires related to couples were given to pregnant women in the intervention groups of mothers alone and control group during all stages and were collected after complement by the couples.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17199" xml_f="17338" txt_i="11580" txt_f="11719">Data were analyzed by Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), and one-way ANOVA through SPSS version 15.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title><offsets xml_i="17397" xml_f="17398" txt_i="11722" txt_f="11723">R</offsets><sc><offsets xml_i="17402" xml_f="17408" txt_i="11723" txt_f="11729">ESULTS</offsets></sc></title><p><offsets xml_i="17424" xml_f="17658" txt_i="11730" txt_f="11964">Mean (SD) of female subjects’ age in mothers alone group was 25.83 (2) years, in the group of couples was 25.93 (2) years, and in control group was 30.53 (2) years.

The present study showed that holding organized educational programs for pregnant women and couples could lead to formation of a positive attitude in pregnant women through knowledge transfer and spouses’ emotional support, and consequently, a reduction in the rate of CS. No similar study had been conducted prior to the present study to educate the couples simultaneously. Evidence shows that the related studies were conducted either on just pregnant women alone or on couples (only one study). In the present study, the levels of men's and women's knowledge about and attitude toward delivery modes and their advantages and disadvantages were low before intervention in the three groups of mothers alone, couples, and control, possibly due to inefficiency of the education provided in health care centers. There was a significant difference between knowledge and attitude scores of men and women in the study groups and control before and after educational intervention. Mean scores of men's and women's knowledge and attitude in the three groups of couples, mothers alone, and control increased after intervention, respectively, but this effect was more in couples and mothers alone groups compared to the control group. It should be noted that scores of knowledge and attitude were more in the group of couples than mothers alone group. It can be concluded that education was effective on promotion of women's and their spouses’ levels of knowledge and attitude. The education provided in the present study was more effective compared to the conventiona l education that is often imparted in health care centers for just the mothers as an official routine to be recorded in their medical files. Higher scores of men's and women's knowledge and attitude in the group of couples can be attributed to the fact that attendance of women accompanied with their spouses and mutual consultation could have increased couples’ motivation to learn educational material and have more appropriate function.

In these two studies, it should be noted that a slight increase in the levels of women's and men's knowledge and attitude in the control group could have resulted from subjects’ curiosity and personal search to find the answers to questions, followed by reviewing the questionnaire. Anyhow, this increase in knowledge and attitude is not as much as that in the study groups. Also, the changes in levels of knowledge and attitude had an ascending trend in all three groups immediately after intervention, 1 month after intervention, and after delivery, compared to before intervention. Therefore, it can be concluded that storage of information and attitude change remained until after delivery. Rate of vaginal delivery was high in mothers alone, couples, and control groups in that order, which showed a significant difference between the study groups (mothers alone and couples) and the control group. Number of vaginal deliveries in the couples group was one case (3.3%) less than that in mothers alone group, possibly due to a higher level of education, which consequently led to higher economic status, more referrals to private offices, as well as harder attitudes to be changed among the subjects in this group.
