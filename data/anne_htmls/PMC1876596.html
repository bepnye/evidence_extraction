People with the condition experience tiredness that carries on for a long period of time and does not get better with rest. Other symptoms include sleeping problems, muscle and joint pains, concentration difficulties, and headaches. The causes of chronic fatigue syndrome are not known. There is evidence for the effectiveness of certain behavioral interventions, such as exercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy, in improving certain symptoms. However, some doctors are concerned that a food supplement called Acclydine, derived from a plant called </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="6448" xml_f="6466" txt_i="2710" txt_f="2728">Solanum dulcamara,</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="6475" xml_f="6625" txt_i="2728" txt_f="2878"> is being used and promoted as a treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome when there is little evidence about the efficacy or safety of this supplement.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6632" xml_f="7705" txt_i="2879" txt_f="3952">The researchers here carried out a randomized trial in The Netherlands, recruiting adult patients who met the internationally accepted criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. The participants were allocated by chance to receive either 14 weeks of treatment with Acclydine together with amino acid supplements or, alternatively, placebo versions of the Acclydine and amino acid tablets. The researchers then measured participants' responses with respect to two primary outcome measures. One of these was how tired participants felt, which was measured using a subscale on a questionnaire called the Checklist Individual Strength scale (CIS-fatigue). The other primary outcome measure was “functional impairment,” which examines how well someone carries out their daily life, using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP-8) scale. The secondary outcome measures included physical activity levels, day-to-day fatigue levels, and the levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) in blood, a hormone that's thought by some researchers to be related to the severity of chronic fatigue.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7712" xml_f="7713" txt_i="3953" txt_f="3954">

The study was designed as a double-blind trial, in which participants and investigators (those collecting the outcome data) did not know whether an individual received Acclydine or placebo. This procedure should help to minimize bias in assessing outcomes. A key limitation of this study is the relatively small number of participants. However, the investigators considered it unlikely that a larger trial would detect a clinically meaningful effect of Acclydine on these outcome measures for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8959" xml_f="8960" txt_i="5162" txt_f="5163">
