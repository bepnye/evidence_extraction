To analyse differences in the baseline parameters between TCM and placebo groups, student t-test was performed. The statistical significance of change differences between two study groups was tested by the Mann-Whitney U test in the comparison of cough symptoms and by the student t-test in the comparison of the results of quality of life scores. Subgroup analysis of age (those older than 35) and sex were performed using Mann-Whitney U test. All statistical tests were 2 sided and exact values for the rank sum. Data entry and analyses were performed with the SPSS software package.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="16600" xml_f="16607" txt_i="10542" txt_f="10549">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16618" xml_f="17125" txt_i="10550" txt_f="11057">Of the total numbers of 141 subjects screened, 81 consented to participate the study.

A significant improvement in symptoms and LCQ scores were observed in both the treatment and control groups during the study period, but no difference was seen between the two groups except in coughing bouts when significantly more improvement were reported in the placebo group (p = 0.027). Women taking TCM had significantly fewer problems with sputum production (p = 0.03) and older subjects (&gt;35 years of age) reported a significant improvement in hoarseness (p = 0.05) when compared to those using placebo.

The results of this study confirmed that URTI was a usually self-limiting disease with its symptoms improved in the first week of presentation. However, the herbal combination used in this study showed it did not improve symptoms when compared to the placebo. This formulary was well tolerated with no adverse effects reported. This finding had significant clinical implications for the Chinese population because this formulary shared many components in commercially available ready-made TCM preparations in the market (for example, Pei Pa Kao). Other components of these preparations might have significant roles to play such as the soothing effect of a syrup preparation. In addition, this study also highlighted some difficulties when conducting a TCM research in a western clinical setting as discussed below.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45291" xml_f="46777" txt_i="20601" txt_f="22087">Firstly, this study covered mainly young working adults, who had expected western treatment. There was an added possibility that, in a fast paced society such as Hong Kong, immediate relief of symptoms might outweigh the other advantages of TCM. This might account for high drop-out rates and the demand for concomitant use of other relieving medication such as antihistamine, NSAIDs and vitamin C, which could potentially have confounding effects on relieving cough symptoms of the TCM preparation. For example, cough induced by post-nasal drip could be reduced by the anti-histamines. However, clinicians usually found that, in reality, patients had expected the other symptoms to be controlled at first presentation and this reflected how the studied drug would be used in a normal clinical setting. Secondly, one might argue that it would be better to compare the TCM in study with a commonly used cough medicine, for example, dextromethorphan. However, it would be very difficult to blind the subjects as they were of very different preparation with different odour and taste (the TCM had its own distinct favour), and when the effectiveness of currently available cough medicine were in question. Thirdly, the symptoms of URTI were usually very subtle and hence a very sensitive tool might be required to measure the changes in such a short period of time. LCQ was originally designed to measure changes in chronic cough and no tools tracking changes in acute cough was available.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46784" xml_f="46947" txt_i="22088" txt_f="22251">Available research and evidence of using TCM in treating cough was limited and only two studies were found in literature search using Medline: one on tumeric oil [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"><offsets xml_i="46979" xml_f="46981" txt_i="22251" txt_f="22253">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46988" xml_f="47043" txt_i="22253" txt_f="22308">] and the other on Feiyan Chuansou Oral Liquid (FCOL) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="47075" xml_f="47077" txt_i="22308" txt_f="22310">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47084" xml_f="47548" txt_i="22310" txt_f="22774">].

In all these studies, a standard herbal formula was used to irrespective of "TCM differentiation". "TCM differentiation" was the fundamental to TCM care and treatment whereby TCM practitioners would choose different formulas for different types of cough based on TCM diagnoses made for individual patients. Many TCM research including this one used fixed formula and did not deal with the rationale of such choice and hence the appropriation of the formulation is questionable. On the other hand, if we were to assess the efficacy of Chinese medicine without standardisation, this lack of standardisation would introduce many confounding variables and make comparison impossible.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48278" xml_f="48537" txt_i="23459" txt_f="23718">In Hong Kong, polypharmacy (a URTI patient received an average of 1.3 cough medicine) and using dangerous drugs such as theophylline or steroid at the risk of developing drugs interactions, side effects or complications, was common in the management of URTI [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="48568" xml_f="48569" txt_i="23718" txt_f="23719">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="48576" xml_f="48760" txt_i="23719" txt_f="23903">].

However, evidence on the effectiveness of different types of anti-tussive was inconclusive. At best, only a limited number of anti-tussive such as dextromethorphan and guaifenesin may be helpful in relieving this symptom. Since Chinese herbal medicine was widely used and accepted in Hong Kong, it might provide a good base to look into its role in relieving acute cough symptom as some TCM ingredients had already been shown to be effective. The studied combination in the tablet preparation did not show any overall self-reported improvement in terms of acute symptoms or quality of life. Other factors such as syrup preparation or placebo effects might have contributed to the popularity of herbal cough medicine available to the general public. Further search for a safe and effective TCM was warranted.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49841" xml_f="49854" txt_i="24934" txt_f="24947">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49865" xml_f="49906" txt_i="24948" txt_f="24989">URTI – Upper Respiratory Tract Infections</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49913" xml_f="49947" txt_i="24990" txt_f="25024">TCM – Traditional Chinese Medicine</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49954" xml_f="49989" txt_i="25025" txt_f="25060">LCQ – Leicester cough questionnaire</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="50011" xml_f="50030" txt_i="25062" txt_f="25081">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="50041" xml_f="50101" txt_i="25082" txt_f="25142">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="50123" xml_f="50145" txt_i="25144" txt_f="25166">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="50156" xml_f="50418" txt_i="25167" txt_f="25429">WCWW and ELYW designed, supervised and wrote up the report.
