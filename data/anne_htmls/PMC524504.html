An amniotomy was performed and the amniotic fluid was found to be clear and a vaginal delivery was achieved within 6 hours.

All of the women were nulliparous with intact membranes and at more than forty weeks' gestation with no antenatal complications and all had an unfavorable cervix. In these carefully selected patients, misoprostol at the dose used not only shortened the time between induction and delivery (11.9 vs. 15.6 h), but it also was significantly more effective than dinoprostone. The positive point was that this result was achieved with a very low CS rate even in the dinoprostone group, (7.5%, and 13.3%), respectively. A difference of 5% in favor of misoprostol, although not statistically significant, might have clinical importance in terms of patient health and cost effectiveness.

In order to avoid uterine hyperstimulation and abnormal FHR tracings, we used for first time in the literature, a 9 h interval between the prostaglandin doses. Although we indeed achieved a low rate of uterine hyperstimulation syndrome (2.5% with misoprostol and 1.2% with dinoprostone, respectively), we still noticed a trend towards a high rate of abnormal FHR tracings during induction with misoprostol.

In the misoprostol group, the majority of women also underwent either a CS or a vacuum operative delivery due to non-reassuring FHR. If neonatal outcomes such as neonatal resuscitation, low Apgar score in the first minute and admittance to the neonatal unit within the first 24 hours (none of the above were statistically significant but they were more frequent with misoprostol) are taken into account, misoprostol may increase these complications in labor. Thus, although our sample size cannot determine safety, misoprostol use is associated with a higher chance of admittance to the neonatal unit within 24 hours even in the absence of asphyxia. This evidence indicates that the faster approach to childbirth is not necessarily the better one.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34148" xml_f="34267" txt_i="20389" txt_f="20508">Attempting an explanation to the aforementioned side effects of misoprostol use and taking into account other reports [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="34298" xml_f="34299" txt_i="20508" txt_f="20509">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34306" xml_f="34307" txt_i="20509" txt_f="20510">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31"><offsets xml_i="34339" xml_f="34341" txt_i="20510" txt_f="20512">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34348" xml_f="34349" txt_i="20512" txt_f="20513">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"><offsets xml_i="34381" xml_f="34383" txt_i="20513" txt_f="20515">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34390" xml_f="34867" txt_i="20515" txt_f="20992">], it appears that the increase in clinically relevant adverse effects is not only misoprostol related but it may be dose dependent. Lyons et al. have recently shown in term pregnant rats that a higher dose of misoprostol is needed to induce PGE2 secretion in the cervix than in the myometrium, and furthermore that EP3 receptors (prostaglandin E2 receptors) are differentially expressed in the myometrium (increased) than in the cervix (unaltered) in response to misoprostol [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"><offsets xml_i="34899" xml_f="34901" txt_i="20992" txt_f="20994">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34908" xml_f="36127" txt_i="20994" txt_f="22213">]. The above findings indicate that misoprostol not only acts better on the myometrium than on the cervix, but an even higher dose is needed in order to ripen the cervix. Thus, it seems reasonable that increasing the interval between repeated misoprostol doses should reduce the risk of an asynchrony between a well or even hyper-stimulated uterus and a still not efficiently ripened cervix. Misoprostol probably has a large inter-patient variability in terms of pharmacokinetics, but it is also probable that the 50 mcg dosage may induce asynchrony between immature cervix effacement and uterine contractions, resulting in a more rapid but also more "stressful" labor. Based on these findings, we would propose, in future, a slight modification of the misoprostol protocol used in this study. An initial lower dose of misoprostol (20–25 mcg), followed by 50 mcg should be considered in trying to achieve priming of the cervix without inducing such high uterine contractility and neonatal complications. Indeed, in a recent study comparing 25 mcg misoprostol with 1 mg dinoprostone administered vaginally every four hours, the admission rate to neonatal intensive unit was significantly lower in the misoprostol group [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"><offsets xml_i="36159" xml_f="36161" txt_i="22213" txt_f="22215">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36168" xml_f="36170" txt_i="22215" txt_f="22217">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36177" xml_f="36604" txt_i="22218" txt_f="22645">It still has to be mentioned that in many of our participants, the vertex was not engaged in the pelvic inlet on the day of admittance and this should have been included as an independent risk factor in the initial study design.

However, certain aspects concerning fetal well being during labor induction remain questionable. Larger prospective studies comparing elective induction to expectant management after a completed 40-week gestation (on the basis of early ultrasound biometry) might reveal a subgroup of women, such
