In an environment of limited resources, it makes sense to provide expertise, and all the time and individual attention a patient needs, but not more. Stepped care models represent endeavours to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of decisions about allocation of resources in therapy. Not all elderly with subthreshold anxiety or depression need the same type and intensity of preventive intervention. Frequently, complaints will disappear without active intervention. Some may be helped by reading a self-help book or watching an instructional video. Others could benefit from a brief psycho-educational group conducted by a paraprofessional or problem solving treatment, and still others may require a form of pharmacotherapy or more intensive individual psychological treatment.
