Secondly, the singing teacher had reported that she felt that after six weeks she was “only just starting to make progress” with many of the participants. Feedback from participants supported this, so the trial duration was increased to eight weeks. Thirdly, although the initial trial found no change in functional exercise capacity, assessed using the incremental shuttle walk test, patients reported that they felt able to do more and cope better with daily tasks, so we added physical activity monitoring to see if this translated into changes in daily activity.

The improvement in health status may have arisen directly through effects on breathing pattern, posture or the learning of techniques to hasten recovery from episodes of dyspnoea but we have no specific data on physiological changes to address these questions. Interestingly, these perceived improvements were not reflected in objective outcome measures. This was a relatively small pilot study but it does raise interesting questions about the appropriateness of outcome measures for this sort of complex and relatively personalized intervention. Although they were not significantly different, the control of breathing measures, as in our previous pilot, paradoxically favored the non-singing group. These tests were developed for evaluating hyperventilation so may not be appropriate for COPD patients. As both relate to breath-holding it may be that participants in the singing group had learned to make a more relaxed and thus less deep inhalation leading to worse performance on these specific tests.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35412" xml_f="35570" txt_i="21228" txt_f="21386">Physical activity limitation is an important feature of COPD being associated with muscle weakness, more rapid disease progression and reduced health status

Translating this into clinical practice, singing is more likely to be of benefit to patients who believe it will be helpful.

Different models are possible ranging from an intensive one to one approach continued indefinitely through a fixed period of sessions through to a long term group approach with flexible participation. Decisions about this are likely to be dependent on practical and economic factors. A rolling rather than a fixed program may offer greater flexibility for participants but has the disadvantage that this may impede the group’s progression as they acquire new skills because “beginners” will need to be taught basic techniques. It is also worth noting that over half the session-time was normally spent on physical warm-ups, breathing exercises and singing exercises; under half singing songs: this proportion is perhaps different to a ‘normal’ community singing group in its emphasis on technique over song. A further issue is group size. Sessions usually involved 4 to 6 people and this would be a different experience to taking part in a larger choir an issue that could be addressed in future work.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37872" xml_f="38379" txt_i="23515" txt_f="24022">A limitation of the study is that the singing group was twice weekly and the film discussion weekly which may have influenced the “dose” of social interaction with the singing group spending more time in the group activity.
