xml_i="43734" xml_f="44424" txt_i="27373" txt_f="28063">In this community trial, people with leg ulcers who were mobile were randomized to receive care in either their homes or in a nurse-led clinic. Care was delivered by the same specially trained team of nurses in both settings guided by an evidence-based protocol for assessment and management. Healing at 3-months and recurrence were comparable and not statistically different between the clinic (58.3% healed, 24.6% recurred) and home care group (56.7%, 21.5% recurred). Both groups had relatively high healing rates at 3 months compared to what has been reported in the literature which is likely due to the organization and consistency in delivery of evidence-based care in both settings.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44431" xml_f="44450" txt_i="28064" txt_f="28083">In our first study[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="44482" xml_f="44484" txt_i="28083" txt_f="28085">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44491" xml_f="46612" txt_i="28085" txt_f="30206">] using a pre-post design, we demonstrated the feasibility and acceptance of using an evidence-based protocol. Results indicated that the implementation of evidence-based care with a specially trained team was related to a more than doubling of healing at 3-months and savings in terms of nursing time and supplies. Further, this randomized health services trial provides the first comprehensive evaluation of clinic versus home care in a Canadian context. Unlike the UK studies, we found similar outcomes in healing regardless of venue of care provided that the quality of care is similar. This is due to the organization of care in home and clinic being similar in the current study whereas, the home delivered care was more varied in the previous trials. We conclude that organization of care is more important than setting with the key elements being: an explicit evidence-based protocol, specially trained nurses with enough wound practice to maintain skills, accessible equipment (e.g. dopplers, high compression bandages), and administrative support for a longer first visits to complete a comprehensive initial assessment and development of a care plan. Given this, health service planners and decision-makers could offer community leg ulcer care in either a clinic or home setting and expect good results if the team follows an evidence protocol and are specially trained. Such an option is important in the Canadian environment because factors such as, the size of the population, urban-rural mix, as well as feasibility to set-up clinics in a region is quite variable. Practically speaking, clinic care has the advantage of readily available supplies that may hasten immediate implementation of care once the comprehensive assessment is complete compared to the home setting where supplies may have to be ordered and delivered, resulting in a delay in implementation of the treatment plan. With nursing hours typically considered a scarce resource and with increasing pressure on home care resources to take on more, authorities might consider offering able clients the option to attend clinics to access care.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46619" xml_f="47243" txt_i="30207" txt_f="30831">An interesting phenomenon discovered during this trial was that, although there was enthusiasm to participate in a wound study with one-year follow-up commitment, many participants expressed strong preferences with 54% of these preferring home delivered care and 46% preferring clinic delivered care. In total, 40% of potential trial participants were excluded from randomization due to stated preference. A future study will examine if after adjustment for co-morbid conditions, and severity and duration of ulcer, whether populations with stated treatment preferences have better outcomes regardless of treatment selected.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="47259" xml_f="47283" txt_i="30832" txt_f="30856">Limitations of the study</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47294" xml_f="47859" txt_i="30857" txt_f="31422">Our trial has some limitations. First, it might be considered a limitation that nurses providing care were involved in the collection of data. Blinding the nurse to the setting was obviously not feasible and once bandages were applied it would have been excessively intrusive (and monumentally expensive) to remove them solely for the purpose of an outcome assessment. On the other hand, our small team of dedicated specially trained nurses, ensured expert, quality outcome assessments by measuring healing in a rigorous and consistent manner regardless of setting.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47866" xml_f="49166" txt_i="31423" txt_f="32723">Secondly, due to an unexpected expression of strong preference for either clinic or home-delivered care the trial resulted in being underpowered, however given the observed difference in rate of healing between the two arms (1.6%). Assuming this difference is clinically significant (which most would agree it is not), the trial would have required a sample size of approximately 15,000 per arm to detect this difference. Even if the current trial continued until the predicted sample size was achieved (100 per arm) and the remaining ~40 patients per arm that were recruited during this period, demonstrated a 20% rate of healing in the clinic and a 40% rate of healing in the home, the final healing rates of ~52% for clinic and ~45% for home, would not be statistically significant. The 1.6% difference obtained in our study is nowhere near the 20% difference anticipated based on previous studies. Further, if this difference was considered clinically important, which arguably it is not, we would have needed ~800/arm to demonstrate it. So although sample size was not achieved, we were able to demonstrate that there were no significant differences in healing rates between the two groups and it will hopefully provide data for others to use in developing sample sizes for future wound studies.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49173" xml_f="50428" txt_i="32724" txt_f="33979">Thirdly, patient preference may have an impact on the type of health services provided in a geographical area. It will be important for future studies to systematically monitor the reasons for an individual's stated preference to be treated in either the home or at a clinic. In general, comments indicated that many patients preferred clinic because it gave them a specific appointment time versus not knowing when the nurse was going to arrive at their home, particularly for employed patients. For some, the clinic provided an outing with social contact that would otherwise not be available to them, while others felt it too difficult to make the arrangements required to visit the clinic, including transportation, parking and distance to walk. However, many of the factors that lead to a stated preference (e.g., mobility, employment, social contact) also introduce bias into the sample, therefore future studies are necessary to examine the impact of preference on outcome. Finally, our study took place in two regions within southeastern Ontario that included both urban and rural components, and a culturally mixed population. These populations may not be representative of other areas where high density or more homogenous populations are found.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="50456" xml_f="50466" txt_i="33982" txt_f="33992">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="50477" xml_f="51809" txt_i="33993" txt_f="35325">The results from this health services trial differ from previous reports which have concluded that clinic care is superior to home care at improving leg ulcer healing. Organization of care, rather than setting is the crucial factor. We found that when quality wound care was supported with a service model, i.e. following evidence-based recommendations, and being delivered by a well-trained, dedicated nursing team, that similar healing results can be attained whether the leg ulcer care is delivered in the home or in a nurse clinic. Our data also suggests that a significant proportion of patients have preferences for care in both settings. The trial provides the first Canadian data on this health services issue and from a planning perspective, if feasible in a region, health authorities should consider both settings in order to provide mobile individuals with choice. Future research will be needed to investigate the relative efficiencies of clinic care compared to usual home care with particular attention to local environment, the various economies of scale (large, medium and small health regions), population dispersion between urban and rural, numbers of nursing agencies and nurse providers contracted to deliver wound care, organization of primary care and referral patterns and other important contextual factors.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="51831" xml_f="51850" txt_i="35327" txt_f="35346">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="51861" xml_f="51919" txt_i="35347" txt_f="35405">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="51941" xml_f="51963" txt_i="35407" txt_f="35429">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="51974" xml_f="52154" txt_i="35430" txt_f="35610">MBH and IDG were principal investigators on the trial and responsible for conceptualization, ethical approval, the conduct and management of the RCT and interpretation of the data.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="52161" xml_f="52310" txt_i="35611" txt_f="35760">KL, EVK, MB, PW, TB and TP comprised the trial co-investigators team and contributed to the design of the study, analyses and interpretation of data.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="52317" xml_f="52373" txt_i="35761" txt_f="35817">All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="52395" xml_f="52418" txt_i="35819" txt_f="35842">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="52429" xml_f="52493" txt_i="35843" txt_f="35907">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/8/243/prepub"></ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are indebted to the many individuals with leg ulcers who gave generously of their time to participate in the study.
