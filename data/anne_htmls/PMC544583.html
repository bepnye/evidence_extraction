The controversy relates to factors eliciting pain and some prognostic factors such as the interpretation of pain at the symphysis. Recent research about treatment strategies also reflects those various opinions, in fact suggesting there is professional uncertainty about the optimal approach. Currently, physiotherapists often prescribe a pain-contingent treatment regime of relative rest and avoiding several day-to-day activities. Additionally, treatment more often includes an exercise program to guide rectification of the muscle imbalance and alignment of the pelvic girdle.

We have paid a lot of attention to difficulties in recruitment such as busy consultation hours and not feasible recruitment procedures. Therefore, we designed a recruitment protocol that is as simple as possible, not restrictive, and demanding a minimum of time from midwives and gynecologists. Standardized written information about the cohort and intervention study is available for every potentially eligible woman and to be handed out by the midwife or gynecologist. Several steps are taken to encourage participation of the midwives and gynecologists. We distributed newsletters about the developments in the cohort and intervention study every three months and visited the practices and meetings of midwives on a regular basis. Any questions regarding trial questions received prompt feedback. The flexibility of the trial procedure is also guaranteed by assessing potential candidates for the trial at home.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12894" xml_f="14468" txt_i="7272" txt_f="8846">Women are included in the cohort if they are at least 18 years old, pregnant and well versed in Dutch language. Women are given written information explaining the aims and contents of the cohort and intervention study before they decide to participate. Concerning the intervention study they are told that to current knowledge the two investigating treatment options are considered to be equally effective. The moment of inclusion for the intervention study lies at about three weeks after delivery. An individual woman enters the intervention study after signing informed consent for both the cohort and intervention study during early pregnancy and meets the in- and exclusion criteria of the intervention study three weeks after delivery. Women are included when having pain in the pelvic girdle and/or low back with an onset during pregnancy or just after delivery (cohort data), are restricted in their normal daily activities because of pelvic girdle and/or low back pain and if there is a delay in recuperation (not yet in the condition to participate satisfactory in housekeeping and care of children because of the complaints under investigation). The severity of symptoms must be varying with physical activities and time during the day. Women diagnosed with a relevant specific pathology (such as nerve root pathology, rheumatoid disorders, carcinoma, obstetric complications) that affects pain and activities of daily life are excluded. Exclusion also occurs in case of family related or psychosocial problems or when a disablement procedure is not yet finished.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14475" xml_f="14615" txt_i="8847" txt_f="8987">Final important aspects for in-/exclusion are the willingness of a woman to participate in the study or having a clear treatment preference[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><offsets xml_i="14647" xml_f="14649" txt_i="8987" txt_f="8989">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14656" xml_f="15216" txt_i="8989" txt_f="9549">]. We only included women who did not indicate such a preference and who were willing to take the 50% risk of receiving a referral to a participating physiotherapist (and treatment option) or the freedom of choosing a therapist by themselves (usual care). Including only women who are naïve (who never received treatment for their complaints during this pregnancy or earlier pregnancies) will result in an unacceptable reduction in the number of eligible patients.

We therefore focused on criteria such as a delay in recuperation and restrictions in normal daily activities caused by pregnancy-related pelvic girdle and/or low back pain. However, other studies in this field formulated inclusion/exclusion criteria based on certain diagnostic classification strategies. Although rationales of these strategies greatly differ, they all attach great importance to the outcomes of particular (albeit different) diagnostic tests. In the absence of a clear definition and reference standard to diagnose pregnancy-related pelvic girdle and/or low back pain, the outcomes of these procedures not only led to different selections of women having complaints, the prognostic and diagnostic importance of these subgroups also remain unclear (Bastiaenen et al. personal communication).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16193" xml_f="16713" txt_i="10514" txt_f="11034">Exclusion of differential diagnoses is a major point of concern. For that reason we included a history taking and a physical examination protocol that focuses on differential diagnoses at first and then on the formulated inclusion criteria. The various specific physical examination tests to diagnose pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain are left aside.

A positive answer from a participating woman from the cohort and/or her midwife on the question: "Do you or does this woman need treatment?" took a central position in these questionnaires. In advance of a possible home visit, a short history taking by telephone took place about two weeks after delivery. History taking focuses on exclusion criteria such as: willing to participate in this part of the study, a diagnosis with relevant specific pathology, limitations in daily life caused by pregnancy-related pelvic girdle and/or low back pain and a delay in recuperation. During a home visit, a standardized history is taken and physical examination to exclude specific pathology is performed. Self-administered questionnaires are used to question the women about pain, limitations in activities, restrictions in participation, pain-related fear, pain catastrophizing, positive and negative affectivity, depression, expectancy of treatment result and quality of life. The questionnaires contain clear instructions for completion with no help or support from others. If a woman meets the selection criteria, she is informed about the aim and method of the intervention study and if she is willing to participate, the informed consent procedure is completed.

The most striking characteristics of a traditional treatment were the character of the therapist-patient relation and the way of goal setting, focusing on disease management [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="22301" xml_f="22303" txt_i="16309" txt_f="16311">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22310" xml_f="22636" txt_i="16311" txt_f="16637">]. There was an explicit professional input and an accent on biomedical factors. A pain contingent regimen of avoiding and limiting several day-to-day activities was important. Compliance and adherence based on these goals played an important part. Therapists were often highly concerned about their patient's pain themselves.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22643" xml_f="23715" txt_i="16638" txt_f="17710">However, interviews with affected women made clear that most of the women were irritated about this regimen in an increasing degree after starting the treatment sessions. The regimen was too strict and on a number of points not geared to the wishes and concerns of the women. These aspects caused a lack of compliance and an unremitting hesitation about a good prognosis and in particular about reassuming certain day-to-day activities after delivery. Therapists did not realize the nature of this problem although they did mention problems with compliance. Some women were not able to get a grip on their condition and left management of their pain and activities of daily life to the therapist. A larger part of the women was more or less uncertain about picking up their full range of activities again after delivery. Their beliefs and concerns about origin and prognosis of their complaints clearly bore the stamp of the introduced biomedical label. The relatively favorable prognosis after delivery was largely unknown to the women as well as to the physiotherapists.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23737" xml_f="23757" txt_i="17712" txt_f="17732">Experimental therapy</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23768" xml_f="24371" txt_i="17733" txt_f="18336">Women, allocated to the intervention group, are referred to a participating physiotherapist in their own neighborhood.

Therapists had to employ problem-solving techniques that engaged women in identifying day-to-day problems or limitations related to pelvic girdle and/or low back pain, setting personal goals, brainstorming options for achieving these goals and developing personal action plans. In subsequent sessions, women reviewed their action plans and their progress towards goals and engaged in problem-solving skills around difficulties that arose in trying to implement their plans. Information about two opposing behavioral responses of pain-related fear (avoidance and confrontation) is given, and a hierarchy of individual fear-eliciting movements and activities is made. Therapists encouraged women in making action plans for specific activities that were avoided.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27421" xml_f="28389" txt_i="20940" txt_f="21908">Complaint-related problem solving is a key skill. The role of the therapist is to encourage women to identify possible causes of a problem, find a number of potential solutions, select one, then try it and finally evaluate the results and possibly adjust the solution. The second important key skill is action planning or goal setting. Often a plan must have been generally unacceptable (such as "go skiing") for a therapist in the usual care. Nevertheless, the protocol of the experimental intervention embraced the point of view that a woman is her own best judge of what is possible. Another major point of action planning is that a woman could not only receive but also give feedback on her own accomplishments. Endorsement by the therapist is very important for a woman to accept her new role. This way of collaborating with a therapist on short-term action planning enabled women to master new skills and to make changes that are realistic and feasible for them.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28396" xml_f="29112" txt_i="21909" txt_f="22625">Therapists also have a role in assisting women in understanding their symptoms. Knowledge of the course of the complaints during pregnancy and after delivery including pain flare-ups in the year after delivery, factors contributing to fluctuations in pain, evidence-based knowledge about etiology and the concept about pain-related fear are essential. Symptoms are explained as having many but not alarming causes, which offers the possibility to choose different actions by the concerning woman. Finally, therapists have a task in practicing social persuasion. A woman is more likely to change her behavior and have confidence in doing so if she perceives those around her, including the therapist to be supportive.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29119" xml_f="29511" txt_i="22626" txt_f="23018">A relationship in which the physiotherapist and the woman make health care decisions together is the basic assumption of the intervention.

Differences between groups and 95%CI are calculated for each outcome measure according to the intention to treat approach. Primary analysis is done by means of analysis of an independent t-test (for continuous outcome variables) and chi-square test (for categorical outcome variables). In order to adjust for possible baseline differences a multiple linear regression analysis for continuous outcome measures is performed with the change scores as dependent variable, treatment option as independent variable and base line scores of the prognostic variables as co-variables. Missing data at the baseline-measurement are substituted by the "mean of series" imputation method. Longitudinal missing data are substituted with the "last value carried forward method". In all comparisons between the two treatment options a two-tailed p-value of 0.05 is considered to indicate statistical significance. Prognostic status at baseline for women with and without missing values for the outcome variables is compared for both groups.

A pragmatic design provides the opportunity to evaluate the value of the experimental intervention without depriving participating patients of the best current treatment option. Including only women who would take the 50% risk of depriving any treatment at all for their complaints during the first 12 weeks after delivery was not a realistic option. The effects of the experimental intervention and usual care are evaluated as they are applied in primary health care. It is not feasible to blind a woman to the applied treatment option, which increases the risk of information bias. We have tried to minimize this type of bias by assessing treatment preference before randomization and excluding women with a clear treatment preference. Details about the enrollment of the trial underscored this necessity (n = 50 excluded because of a clear treatment preference). The research-physiotherapist dealing with the baseline measurement was therefore unaware of treatment allocation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45892" xml_f="46507" txt_i="34913" txt_f="35528">Details about the enrollment out of the cohort into the trial also show that the start of the experimental intervention is well timed. Most women have complaints during pregnancy. However, a considerable drop in the number of women having persistent complaints in the first weeks after delivery is observed. Then again, numbers of women having one or more episodes of pain complaints remained stable in the year after delivery. We have seen similar trends of proportions of women with a request for treatment for their complaints during pregnancy (9%), just after delivery (4.8%) and in the year following delivery.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46514" xml_f="47525" txt_i="35529" txt_f="36540">The aim of the experimental intervention is to increase the level of activities. Therefore the primary outcome measure is limitations in activities. The contrast between both interventions is an important issue in this study. Major features that underscore the contrast are the character of the patient-therapist relationship, pain-contingent versus time-contingent treatment, compliance to a regime of avoiding and limiting activities versus action planning and personal goal setting by the women themselves. Among therapists, the approach of the experimental intervention is not widespread at all. The participating therapists are explicitly asked to not give any information about the contents of the experimental treatment to therapists who do not participate in the experimental intervention. It is necessary to interest physiotherapists in the trial for an efficient performing of the experimental treatment option, which can be achieved by a relevant research question and in practice applicable results.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="47547" xml_f="47566" txt_i="36542" txt_f="36561">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47577" xml_f="47636" txt_i="36562" txt_f="36621">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="47658" xml_f="47680" txt_i="36623" txt_f="36645">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47691" xml_f="47830" txt_i="36646" txt_f="36785">CHGB: first author, is involved in the design, data collection, statistical analyses, and the development of the experimental intervention.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47837" xml_f="48067" txt_i="36786" txt_f="37016">RAdB: participated in the design, coordination, statistical analyses, have made substantial contributions to the development of the experimental intervention, is involved in revising the article for important intellectual content.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48074" xml_f="48269" txt_i="37017" txt_f="37212">PMJCW: participated in the design, has made substantial contribution to the development of the experimental intervention and is involved in revising the article for important intellectual content</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48276" xml_f="48443" txt_i="37213" txt_f="37380">JWSV: has made substantial contributions to the development of the experimental intervention and is involved in revising the article for important intellectual content</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48450" xml_f="48578" txt_i="37381" txt_f="37509">JMB: participated in the design and statistical analyses, is involved in revising the article for important intellectual content</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48585" xml_f="48644" txt_i="37510" txt_f="37569">ABAK: participated in the design and collecting of the data</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48651" xml_f="48721" txt_i="37570" txt_f="37640">AH: participated in the design, recruitment and collecting of the data</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48728" xml_f="48930" txt_i="37641" txt_f="37843">PvdB and GGME; participated in the design, have made substantial contributions to conception, design and experimental intervention and revising the article critically for important intellectual content.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48937" xml_f="48988" txt_i="37844" txt_f="37895">All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49010" xml_f="49033" txt_i="37897" txt_f="37920">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49044" xml_f="49108" txt_i="37921" txt_f="37985">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/4/67/prepub"></ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The funding for this study was provided by the Dutch Board of health insurance companies (Cvz)as a part of a research project titled " Peripartum pelvic pain during pregnancy and after delivery". We would like to express our gratitude to all the participating women, thank Foekje Stelma as the research-physician of this project and Conny de Zwart for the logistic assistance (including randomization).</p><p>We also like to thank Gerda Kraag for performing and analyzing the interviews, Jeroen de Jong and Peter Heuts for their contribution to the training of the therapists in the experimental intervention group and Peter Heuts also for chairing the group meetings. Also very important for the project were the participating policlinics gynecology and midwives. Leonie van Gemert and Jacqueline Heesters, both occupational therapists from Blixembosch rehabilitation center Eindhoven provided important information and advices for the booklets, especially the ergonomic hints for young mothers. Finally, we thank the entire group of therapists for their enthusiastic participation during the project.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
