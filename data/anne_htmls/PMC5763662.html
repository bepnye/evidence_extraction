A total of 68 patients were randomly divided into control and observation group (n=34). All the patients were treated with renal cyst incision and drainage under flexible ureteroscope. The control group was under ultrasound guidance. The observation group was combined with MPR-CTU, the safety and efficacy was compared. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the success rate and the time of cyst treatment (P&gt;0.05). The incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications of the observation group was significantly lower than that of the control group. After 1 month follow-up, the total effective rate of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group, the difference was statistically significant (P&lt;0.05).

Internal drainage combined with decompression can make the larger cysts combined and connected to the collection system, and perform decompression to deeper cysts or connect them to larger cysts, then communicate with the connection system, therefore most of the cyst fluid is excreted from the urinary tract, the drainage is more reasonable and smooth, which is confirmed by a number of studies (</offsets><xref rid="b18-etm-0-0-5379" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="17414" xml_f="17416" txt_i="11692" txt_f="11694">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17423" xml_f="17424" txt_i="11694" txt_f="11695">,</offsets><xref rid="b19-etm-0-0-5379" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="17469" xml_f="17471" txt_i="11695" txt_f="11697">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17478" xml_f="18566" txt_i="11697" txt_f="12785">) has better clinical safety and effectiveness. It is also concluded from this study that there is no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the incidence of surgery and operation time on cysts, the incidence of operative and postoperative complications in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group. After 1-month follow-up, the total effective rate of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group. The three-dimensional image of the entire urinary system, including the calyx, renal pelvis, ureter and bladder can be obtained through CT urography (CTU) multi-phase dynamic enhanced scan. By combining with MPR image post-processing technique, the location of cysts and their relationship with the collection system can be evaluated comprehensively. Therefore, we believe that MPR-CTU combined with renal cyst incision and drainage under intraoperative ultrasound guided ureteroscope has a higher safety and effectiveness in the treatment of renal cystic disease, it is worthy of clinical application.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18573" xml_f="18593" txt_i="12786" txt_f="12806">Studies found that (</offsets><xref rid="b20-etm-0-0-5379" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18638" xml_f="18640" txt_i="12806" txt_f="12808">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18647" xml_f="18648" txt_i="12808" txt_f="12809">,</offsets><xref rid="b21-etm-0-0-5379" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18693" xml_f="18695" txt_i="12809" txt_f="12811">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18702" xml_f="19804" txt_i="12811" txt_f="13913">) when treating endogenous cyst with flexible ureteroscope, the best incision position cannot be precisely determined; it was difficult to find the best laser rupture position for the cyst in the calyx and pelvis by ureteroscope; the incision cannot be found because of the thick cyst wall. Therefore, effective assessment of whether the flexible ureteroscope can handle specific endogenous cysts before surgery and how to effectively locate the cyst is a key factor for the success of surgery. The main innovative points of this study are: flexible ureteroscope technology is currently the most minimally invasive technique, treating the cyst via the urinary approach is most in line with the natural cavity path, with characteristics of repeatable operating, suitable for recurrence patients after open or laparoscopic surgery. There is no clinical report of MPR-CTU assisted ultrasonography in the treatment of renal cystic disease with ureteroscope localization within renal calyx. The deficiency of this research is the small sample size, short follow-up time, it still needs further verification.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The present
