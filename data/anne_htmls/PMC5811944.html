It is worth mentioning that the strategy of home-based care was dominant over hospital-based care in terms of less cost to reduce a unit of HbA1c in diabetic patients. This study also shows that to achieve prevention, an additional hypoglycemia in diabetics 106.93 US Dollar is needed. This cost needs to be compared with the Iranian threshold of cost-effectiveness values for diabetes management.</offsets></p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="19468"
