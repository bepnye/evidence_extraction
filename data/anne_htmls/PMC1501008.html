Everyday actions were so named because they reflected activities which are not necessarily seen to be therapeutic but which are frequently undertaken or experienced in daily life. Complementary treatments included yoga, massage, relaxation therapy and meditation. Complementary treatments were those identified through a systematic search of the literature, but which were not commonly identified in clinical practice guidelines. Dietary treatments included avoiding caffeine and drinking alcohol. Professional treatments included seeking the help of general practitioners, counselors and psychologists, anti-depressants, cognitive-behavioural therapy, counseling and reading self-help books. A previously used category – non-prescription treatments (which includes painkillers, St John's wort, fish oils, vitamins and 'cut down on alcohol') – was not able to be used in the present analysis because most items were too infrequently endorsed. Two components within this category, 'vitamins' and 'cut out alcohol'- were included in the dietary category.

Separate linear regressions were used to examine the reported use of each specific treatment and its association with depression (CES-D scores) at post intervention and at six months. A further four linear regressions examined whether the category types of treatment predicted depression. A second set of supplementary analyses investigated the relationship between the severity of depression and the reported uptake of specific treatments or sources, controlling for intervention type. A series of separate logistic regressions were used to assess the effect of the severity of depression (CES-D scores) at pre-intervention on the use of each treatment. Four linear regressions were used to examine the impact of depression on the number of every day, complementary, dietary and professional treatments used. No formal adjustment was undertaken for the number of comparisons that were tested. However, the majority of effects reported would remain significant even if correct using a extremely conservative approach such as the Bonferroni method.

The results for the logistic and linear regressions are also displayed. Compared to BluePages, MoodGYM participants were more likely to report using cognitive behavioural therapy, exercise and massage. Both MoodGYM and control participants were more likely to report listening to music than were BluePages participants. Compared to BluePages, the control group was more likely to report seeking the help of family and friends. Both MoodGYM and the control condition were associated with the reported use of more everyday treatments. MoodGYM was also associated with the seeking of more complementary and professional treatments. These analyses were repeated as six months (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"><offsets xml_i="19485" xml_f="19486" txt_i="14504" txt_f="14505">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19493" xml_f="20251" txt_i="14505" txt_f="15263">).

However, MoodGYM participants were still more likely to say they had used cognitive-behavioural therapy than those in BluePages (OR = 2.73; p = 0.011), and to use everyday treatments (B = .48, p = .044). After six months those in the control group were still more likely to have listened to music than those in the BluePages intervention (OR = 2.10, p = .005), and were now more likely to report the use of pets as a form of treatment than those in BluePages (OR = 1.86, p = .018).

Frequently adopted actions were seeking out family and friends, exercise, listening to music, engaging in pleasant events and being with pets. Taking antidepressants, reading self-help books for depression, using vitamins and using alcohol were associated with higher pretest depression scores. Seeking help from counsellors/psychologists and general practitioners was also associated with higher baseline depression scores, as was the total number of professional treatments.

help seeking behaviours relative to the control condition and MoodGYM. For specific treatment types, compared to MoodGYM, Bluepages use was associated with fewer reports of having taken up CBT, exercise, massage or music. Participants also had lower use of professional treatments, and everyday and complementary categories of treatment. BluePages was associated with decreased use of music, decreased help seeking from friends and family and decreased use of everyday treatments compared to the control condition. Specific self reported actions of participants over the trial period were associated with reduced depression symptoms at endpoint for the use of relaxation, and doing more enjoyable things, but not for other evidenced based and non-evidenced based treatments. Taking antidepressants, reading self-help books for depression, using alcohol and seeking professional treatments were associated with higher baseline depression scores.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="71848" xml_f="71922" txt_i="31033" txt_f="31107">Frequency with which treatments were sought and types of treatments sought</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="71933" xml_f="72776" txt_i="31108" txt_f="31951">In some respects, these findings are similar to those reported in the recent help seeking literature. First, there is a low level of seeking help from mental health professionals and a preference for everyday treatments, rather than evidence-based treatments. Although figures might be better gauged from representative samples of the population rather than from a sample with high symptoms, only approximately 24% of participants in this study with elevated depression reported seeking the help of a GP. This concords closely with findings by Oliver et al., in the UK that 28% of individuals with high GHQ scores sought help from a general practitioner, and findings in Australia, that 33% of adults with an affective disorder and 56% of those with anxiety disorder did not seek help for their disorder in the last 12 months.

BluePages was associated with a reduction in the use of music, the use of family and friends for support and the use of everyday treatments. We postulated that BluePages might exert its effect through the initiation of self help for evidence based treatments. However, the findings of the study suggest that the help seeking influence of BluePages may be to decrease the use of non-evidence based interventions. For example, seeking support from friends and relatives may be unnecessary, unhelpful, even toxic under certain circumstances and the website may have served to reduce inappropriate help seeking actions. This accords with some adolescent literature that reports that help seeking from younger friends may not be helpful. Moreover, it is possible that BluePages served as a partial substitute for the support and reassurance that might normally be sought from family and friends. The mechanism by which the psychoeducation website exerts it influence on depression symptoms needs further investigation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="75413" xml_f="76293" txt_i="34360" txt_f="35240">The increase in the reported use of CBT in the MoodGYM condition is to be expected since CBT formed the core of the intervention and participants knew CBT was offered in their intervention. The reasons for the increased reporting of massage and exercise are less clear. Neither exercise nor massage was directly encouraged by the MoodGYM site although one of 29 self help exercises mentioned the use of physical activities as a means of rewarding positive thinking. One explanation is that massage and exercise arose a consequence of a reduction in depression symptoms. More generally, this explanation predicts that help seeking is linked to depression improvement across both MoodGYM and BluePages sites. However, although both MoodGYM and BluePages were equally effective in reducing depression symptoms, only MoodGYM was associated with reported increases in these activities.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="76315" xml_f="76387" txt_i="35242" txt_f="35314">Relationships between help sought and a reduction in depression symptoms</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="76398" xml_f="77960" txt_i="35315" txt_f="36877">The present study found that relaxation therapy, doing enjoyable things, and not using alcohol were associated with lower depression symptoms at post test. These relationships were found controlling for both baseline levels of depression and intervention type. Taking specific evidenced based treatments such as anti-depressant medication (reported by one quarter of the participants) did not predict improvement in depression outcomes. Interpretations of these associations must consider the correlational nature of these relationships as well as the complexity of tracking the uptake of a range of treatments. For example, there may be a number of reasons for failing to find a relationship for anti-depressant medication. First, improvement in mood might be associated itself with the discontinuation of depression medication or the choice not to investigate this option. Other possible explanations are that participants might be unlikely to take antidepressants if they have engaged in online treatment, or the antidepressant effect for those already on antidepressants at commencement of the trial may have stablized at the time of enrolment in the trial. Conversely, the anti-depressant effect may be too small to detect over a six week period if this intervention is taken up later in the course of the trial. Finally, the medication may have been discontinued or used inappropriately and the use of medication might be combined with a number of positive or negative other treatments.

These individuals may have specific preferences for types of treatment not shared by the general community.

The analyses investigating depression severity and treatments sought are correlational and may reflect differences in the uptake of treatments as a function of changes in depression rather than the influence of particular interventions on the improvement of depression symptoms.

The increased use of professional, everyday and complementary treatments in the MoodGYM condition may be due to the additive effect of increased use of a number of the individual specific treatments.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="81470" xml_f="82284" txt_i="40006" txt_f="40820">Despite these shortcomings the present paper has a number of strengths over previous reports of help seeking in mental health. It is one of the first trials to examine the effect of interventions on both evidence-based and non-evidence based help seeking using adequate comparison groups. The significant findings are that exposure to one internet site results in significantly greater increased help seeking of evidence based treatments (CBT, massage and exercise), and an increase in a range of help seeking. Exposure to BluePages reduces what may be unhelpful responses to mental health problems – seeking support from family and friends. It also confirms severity of depression as a risk factor for help seeking, and reveals the complexity of the relationship between self reported help and treatment outcomes.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="82312" xml_f="82322" txt_i="40823" txt_f="40833">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="82333" xml_f="83020" txt_i="40834" txt_f="41521">Models of 'pathways to care' are often limited because they fail to account for the large numbers of consumers who do not have access to health care or those who have preferences not to use traditional health services.
