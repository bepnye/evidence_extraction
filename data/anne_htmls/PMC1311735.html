This study will have a much greater sample size than all previous studies on music therapy in the field of psychiatry to date. This will enable a more precise estimation of the effect of music therapy. The study will also be more comprehensive than previous studies in terms of how the treatment is defined and treatment fidelity measured, and in terms of the inclusion of potential mediator variables. This comprehensiveness will allow an evaluation of the processes and mechanisms leading to therapeutic change at a greater level of detail than in previous studies in the field. The close link to clinical practice will be ensured through the application of the flexible therapy manual, but also through the choice of the study population. The inclusion criteria for this study define a population that is often being referred to music therapy, and one that is in need of special attention. The results of the study will therefore be well generalisable to and relevant for clinical practice.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="29377" xml_f="29388" txt_i="21780" txt_f="21791">Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29399" xml_f="29990" txt_i="21792" txt_f="22383">The main limitations of this study will include the lack of an alternative or 'placebo' therapy, the partial reliance on self-reports, and the broadness of the sample. Due to the lack of a placebo therapy, it could be argued that we did not control for the effect of receiving attention from a caring person. However, there are several arguments why a placebo therapy would not be adequate for this study. Most importantly, it has been argued that the metaphor of a placebo is conceptually inadequate in psychotherapy research, considering the discussion on common factors in psychotherapy [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="30021" xml_f="30022" txt_i="22383" txt_f="22384">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="30029" xml_f="30258" txt_i="22384" txt_f="22613">]. It is therefore more appropriate to examine the specific processes and mechanisms of therapy by other means, such as the assessment of treatment fidelity and the assessment of mediator variables that we included in the design.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30265" xml_f="30622" txt_i="22614" txt_f="22971">It may also be criticised that self-reports may be biased because of expectancy or social desirability effects. However, for some mental health outcomes, such as self-esteem, there is no alternative to self-reports. The main outcome for this study will however be rated by a blind assessor. Blinding of participants is not possible in psychotherapy studies.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="30629" xml_f="30985" txt_i="22972" txt_f="23328">A final criticism might concern the broad inclusion criteria. The study sample will be broad with regard to diagnoses, but the main inclusion criterion will be unrelated to diagnosis and well linked to an important clinical question. As this will improve generalisability, this last limitation can also as be regarded as one of the strengths of this study.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="31013" xml_f="31032" txt_i="23331" txt_f="23350">Competing interests</offsets></title><p></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="31065" xml_f="31087" txt_i="23353" txt_f="23375">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31098" xml_f="31535" txt_i="23376" txt_f="23813">CG developed the background and design of the study, did the power calculation, helped to develop the therapeutic principles, and drafted the manuscript.
