To inform the translation, the research team gathered input from CDSMP Master Trainers (i.e., national survey, interviews) and employees who had one or more chronic diseases (i.e., focus groups). Master Trainers were selected as participants because of the extensive training they received about the intervention (e.g., content, processes, fidelity), their role hosting lay leader trainings for those who facilitate workshops, and their experience interacting with adults living with chronic conditions. Employees with chronic diseases were selected as participants because of their first-hand experiences living and working with a chronic condition as well as their experience participating in health promotion activities at work. Additionally, the research team engaged in extensive conversations with the program developers throughout the translation process regarding program logistics (e.g., grand-scale dissemination, translation, leader training, fidelity monitoring). Information obtained from these sources was used to develop materials for the translated intervention. The translation resulted in a worksite-tailored version of CDSMP that is referred to as wCDSMP (also known in the community as Live Healthy, Work Healthy).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16609" xml_f="16668" txt_i="8604" txt_f="8663">Unique aspects of wCDSMP relative to CDSMP are provided in </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00851-t001"><offsets xml_i="16718" xml_f="16725" txt_i="8663" txt_f="8670">Table 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16732" xml_f="17615" txt_i="8670" txt_f="9553">. In the formative research described above, Master Trainers indicated that the length (2.5 h) of CDSMP workshop sessions was the most common barrier to implementing workshops in worksite settings. As such, the wCDSMP workshop format was revised to include sixteen 50-min sessions that occur twice a week for eight weeks. When delivered to employees at a worksite, both interventions can be delivered on- or off-site or during or outside of work time (at the discretion of the employer). Both interventions require that workshops be facilitated by two leaders who have completed the 4-day standardized training. To facilitate wCDSMP, leaders must attend an additional bridge training (approximately 4 h).

Sites randomized to receive CDSMP included the city government, county government, a behavioral healthcare facility, a bank, two county school systems (i.e., elementary schools), and a technical college. Intervention workshops were made available to all full-employees at each site. Workshop participants included a mix of employee types with differing roles and supervisory responsibilities. Participants may have known one another prior to workshop participation, and many workshops included participants from multiple organizational divisions (where applicable). Employee participation in workshops was voluntary. There were no eligibility criteria for employees to participate in intervention workshops; however, recruitment efforts aimed to enroll employees with one or more chronic condition. Strategies used to recruit participants were primarily dictated by site-specific recommendations and typically included a combination of emails, brief presentations during regularly scheduled meetings, flyers on bulletin boards, and on-site registration (research team members being physically present in break rooms or other site venues). Sessions were scheduled at times that fit the organization’s work schedule. A total of 10 wCDSMP workshops and 13 CDSMP workshops were delivered between January 2016 and February 2017, 10 of which were after work hours (all at schools), and 13 of which were during work hours (all other locations).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijerph-15-00851"><title><offsets xml_i="21720" xml_f="21740" txt_i="13420" txt_f="13440">2.3.

While the modified format of wCDSMP may be more feasible for on-site delivery (i.e., before, during, and/or after work time), the length of the intervention (i.e., sixteen 50-min sessions over eight weeks) may hinder grand scale adoption.

While this study focused on many aspects of health and work performance, additional outcome measures should be examined to capture the breadth of possible intervention benefits. Future studies from this RCT will investigate a broader range of outcomes related to health and healthcare utilization to further confirm the success of this translational research. Further, additional measures associated with work performance will be examined to assess the intervention’s cost-effectiveness and return on investment. While wCDSMP participants reported improvements for all outcome variables, the sample size for this RCT was modest and may have been underpowered to detect all meaningful changes. Further, all participants reporting one or more chronic conditions were included in analyses, not just those who reported risk or poor health indicators at baseline. Future analyses will examine intervention benefits for each outcome variable in terms of those who reported associated risk for this outcome at baseline (e.g., stress, depression, sleep problems). In our ongoing RCT, we are working to increase the study sample to include more employees at more worksites (and more diverse worksite types) for a more comprehensive understanding of impacts in different populations and settings. This will also help us better understand the appropriateness of wCDSMP and its effectiveness for certain types of work environments and employee job descriptions. The current study examined changes over a 6-month period; however, our RCT will examine changes over a 12-month period to determine the ability of wCDSMP to maintain employee health and productivity over time, relative to Usual Care alternatives.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5-ijerph-15-00851"><title><offsets xml_i="45370" xml_f="45384" txt_i="34285" txt_f="34299">5.

Furthermore, even fewer programs have undergone rigorous development and testing as an evidence-based worksite wellness program. Given the well-documented effectiveness of CDSMP, efforts are needed to increase adoption and dissemination to reach new populations and settings. This study showed the effectiveness of wCDSMP to improve health and work performance among middle-aged employees with one or more chronic conditions. By translating the intervention format and content, we believe wCDSMP can increase the availability and accessibility of this efficacious intervention to workplace settings. The added flexibility afforded by the wCDSMP format has potential to increase its dissemination workplace settings across the U.S. and globally. Employers who offer wCDSMP at their workplace can promote healthy aging among their mid-aged workforce and prevent or delay costly age- and disease-related complications and disability. </offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Heart, Lung, And Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01HL122330.
