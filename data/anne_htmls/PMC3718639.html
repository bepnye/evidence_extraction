by adults who are intimate partners or family members, is a key public health and clinical priority. The prevalence of DVA in the United Kingdom and worldwide is high, and its impact on physical and mental health is detrimental and persistent. There is currently little support within healthcare settings for women experiencing DVA. Psychological problems in particular may be difficult to manage outside specialist services, as conventional forms of therapy such as counseling that do not address the violence may be ineffective or even harmful. The aim of this study is to assess the overall effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a novel psychological intervention tailored specifically for survivors of DVA and delivered by domestic violence advocates based in third-sector organizations.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6879" xml_f="6903" txt_i="893" txt_f="917">Methods and study design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6914" xml_f="8211" txt_i="918" txt_f="2215">This study is an open, pragmatic, parallel group, individually randomized controlled trial. Women ages 16 years and older experiencing domestic violence are being enrolled and randomly allocated to receive usual DVA agency advocacy support (control) or usual DVA agency support plus psychological intervention (intervention). Those in the intervention group will receive eight specialist psychological advocacy (SPA) sessions weekly or fortnightly, with two follow-up sessions, 1 month and then 3 months later. This will be in addition to any advocacy support sessions each woman receives. Women in the control group will receive usual DVA agency support but no additional SPA sessions. The aim is to recruit 250 women to reach the target sample size. The primary outcomes are psychological well-being and depression severity at 1 yr from baseline, as measured by the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation–Outcome Measure (CORE-OM) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. Secondary outcome measures include anxiety, posttraumatic stress, severity and frequency of abuse, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Data from a subsample of women in both groups will contribute to a nested qualitative study with repeat interviews during the year of follow-up.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8233" xml_f="8243" txt_i="2217" txt_f="2227">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8254" xml_f="8549" txt_i="2228" txt_f="2523">This study will contribute to the evidence base for management of the psychological needs of women experiencing DVA.

Randomization is stratified by whether women receive support from the safe house team or from the resettlement team at Next Link and the refuge team or tenant support team at Cardiff Women’s Aid. The randomization program applies stratification with random blocking. Within each stratum, participants are assigned to the treatment group (T) or control group (C) in randomly chosen blocks of two, four or six. Within each block, the order of assignment is also random, so that in a group of four, for example, the permutation TCTC would be equally as likely as TTCC. For each completed block, the allocation ratio is 1:1, so that the number of Ts and Cs will be equal. Allocation is concealed from the researcher until the moment of randomization.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19820" xml_f="21602" txt_i="12180" txt_f="13962">Over the course of the study, women are requested to complete three further questionnaires, at 4, 8 and 12 mo after randomization. Questionnaires are either hand-delivered or sent to the women, depending on the stated preference. Women receive a £10 shopping token after completing the baseline, 4- and 8-month questionnaires and £20 for completion of the 12-months questionnaire. To retain women in the study, researchers make midpoint contacts with women between follow-up points. When researchers are unable to contact a woman on four consecutive occasions, they begin to work through the locator contacts given by the women at the point of recruitment into the study. When a woman cannot be located, researchers continue to use the woman’s last known details. Women are prompted to return questionnaires at 2, 4 and 6 wk after the questionnaires are sent or delivered. Failure to return a questionnaire by week 7 prompts the researcher to begin working through the women’s locator contacts. Researchers continue to prompt women (or their locators) for the return of questionnaire until week 12 after posting. The researcher will call the woman by telephone and, if no answer is received, leave a voice message (unless it has been explicitly stated that it is not safe to do so). After two failed telephone contact attempts, the researcher will send a text message to the woman’s last known mobile telephone number. If there is still no response, the researcher sends a handwritten card to the woman’s last known address. Failure to return a questionnaire by week 12 (after it was sent or delivered) results in the questionnaire’s being noted as missing. Researchers will continue to issue the next questionnaire in the series even if the previous questionnaire was not returned.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21624" xml_f="21636" txt_i="13964" txt_f="13976">Intervention</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21647" xml_f="22153" txt_i="13977" txt_f="14483">Women randomized to receive psychological support in addition to usual DVA agency support will be assigned a specialist psychological advocate (SPA) who has gone through a 25-day manualized training program from a clinical psychologist with expertise in DVA (RAD).

During SPA sessions, the advocates will provide time-limited interventions using a variety of primarily CBT psychological techniques, focusing within any one session on a specific presenting problem, such as hyperarousal, sleeping difficulties or parenting problems. The advocate will aim to empower the client to apply therapeutic strategies (such as relaxation, challenging thoughts or goal-setting) to promote recovery from each problem. Each series of eight sessions varies according to the client’s presenting problems, but typically includes discussions about the impact of domestic abuse on mental health and common reactions, typically including posttraumatic stress and low self-esteem. The client selects a specific topic for each session, and the SPA will use written resources to guide identification of signs (symptoms), the association with experiences of abuse and strategies to overcome them within that session, and through homework tasks to be completed between sessions. Each of the eight sessions can have different content for any therapeutic dyad, although SPAs will focus on building the alliance and safety in the first session and address endings and closure in the eighth session.

The aim of the economic evaluation is to compare the extra cost of providing the PATH intervention with the extra benefits gained to allow judgment about its cost-effectiveness.

The analysis will consider costs associated with the delivery of care from the perspectives of the NHS and personal social services (PSSs), the public sector and society in general.
