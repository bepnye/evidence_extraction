However, the low incremental costs of delivering this Internet program makes it feasible to offer this type of program to large populations with widespread Internet access.</offsets></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>cognitive therapy</kwd><kwd>self-help</kwd><kwd>randomized trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title><offsets xml_i="9067" xml_f="9079" txt_i="3598" txt_f="3610">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9090" xml_f="9470" txt_i="3611" txt_f="3991">Several Internet interventions have emerged in recent years to treat mental and behavioral health problems.

In this earlier study, we randomized 299 adults with highly elevated depression symptoms to either access to the ODIN site, or no access. Participants in both conditions were free to receive treatment as usual (TAU) health care services, including depression medication and psychotherapy. This TAU control condition, consisting principally of antidepressant medication, distinguishes our research from that of most other trials of Internet mental health interventions, which have employed a waitlist control condition. Subjects reported depression symptoms at enrollment and at 4-, 8-, 16-, and 32-weeks follow-up. However, in that trial we found that participants in the intervention group used the ODIN Internet site very infrequently after their initial enrollment session, which may have contributed to the overall negative effects. We concluded that future studies should focus on increasing participant use of the Internet site.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12139" xml_f="13019" txt_i="6044" txt_f="6924">This paper presents the second trial of our pure self-help ODIN program. This time, we added telephone and postcard reminders to the intervention group aimed at increasing participant use of ODIN, and we compared the intervention against a “no access” TAU control condition. We had no hypotheses regarding different website usage attributable to postcard or telephone reminders. However, the latter method required so much more staff time that we wanted to test whether brief telephone contact increased website usage beyond the less expensive postcard reminder. We hypothesized that persons randomized to the ODIN group would report greater reductions in depression symptoms and greater improvements in mental and physical health functioning. We also report general medical and mental health care service utilization data of participants in the 12 months following randomization.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="13060" xml_f="13067" txt_i="6926" txt_f="6933">Methods</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="13087" xml_f="13111" txt_i="6934" txt_f="6958">Subjects and Recruitment</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="13122" xml_f="13409" txt_i="6959" txt_f="7246">We conducted the study in the Kaiser Permanente Northwest HMO, which has about 440000 members in northwest Oregon and southwest Washington.

Subsequently, participants were automatically randomized by the website (using random sequence software) to one of the three groups. Participants in the TAU control group were denied access to the ODIN intervention. Instead, they were linked to an HMO health information website which provided information about depression but no interactive skills training. Participants in the remaining two intervention groups were given immediate access to the ODIN intervention and received either US mail postcards or brief (&lt; 5 minutes) telephone reminders from non-clinician study staff at 2, 8, and 13 weeks after enrollment. The telephone reminder calls were scripted to convey information identical to that included on the postcard reminders. Staff first identified themselves and the study, then reminded participants of the ODIN website address and gave instructions for looking up forgotten passwords. They read a brief description of a feature of the website designed to entice the participant to make a return visit and then concluded the call. The reminder staff had no mental health background, and they were prohibited from engaging in any therapy-like activity. Staff were capable of, and limited to, answering questions only about basic website troubleshooting (eg, difficulty logging on or accessing questionnaires). </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1"><offsets xml_i="15796" xml_f="15804" txt_i="9577" txt_f="9585">Figure 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15811" xml_f="15852" txt_i="9585" txt_f="9626"> provides a summary of the study process.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15859" xml_f="16061" txt_i="9627" txt_f="9829">Participants in all conditions were free to obtain any traditional mental or physical health care services and access any Internet health resources.

The test of difference between groups is a test of the difference in these slopes over time. The random effects modeling includes all data on all participants (an intent-to-treat analysis), but it preserves the measurement time for each observed response (rather than carrying last observations forward). It does so by computing maximum likelihood estimates of the slope over time given the data observed and the covariance structure within subjects. This method, which conditions out the missing data, is called restricted (or residual) maximum likelihood estimation (REML).

This is a consideration because random effects regression methods yield unbiased estimates of missing follow-up data only if the missingness is ignorable (ie, can be predicted from patient characteristics and is unrelated to the study outcome). If loss to follow-up is a function of study outcome, the analyses conducted with imputed but possibly biased data may not accurately reflect the true outcomes. Therefore, we ran a repeated measures analysis predicting follow-up completion at each time point from baseline depression severity, age, sex, recruitment group, and educational attainment. In this model, younger age, male gender, and ODIN intervention assignment all increased the likelihood of missing a follow-up assessment. None of these factors predicted treatment outcome, suggesting they would be unlikely to contribute to the treatment outcomes that we found. However, it is not possible to completely prove that imputed follow-up data are unbiased. Therefore, our results clearly need replication in a sample with minimal and nonsystematic attrition.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34132" xml_f="34153" txt_i="21705" txt_f="21726">
