In primary care, the usual approach towards these patients was the advice to take rest and not return to work before all complaints had disappeared. When complaints persist, these patients are often referred to psychologists from primary and specialized secondary care. As an alternative, ways have been sought to activate the Dutch occupational physician (OP) in primary care. Early 2000, the Dutch Association of Occupational Physicians (NVAB) published a guideline concerning the management by OPs of employees with mental health problems. The guideline received positive reactions from employees, employers and Dutch OPs. This manuscript describes the design of a study, which aims to assess the effects of the guideline, compared with usual care.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4014" xml_f="4028" txt_i="834" txt_f="848">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4039" xml_f="4702" txt_i="849" txt_f="1512">In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), subjects in the intervention group were treated according to the guideline.

The primary outcomes of the study are return to work and treatment satisfaction by the employee, employer, and OP. A secondary outcome is cost-effectiveness of the intervention, compared with usual care. Furthermore, prognostic measures are taken into account as potential confounders. A process evaluation will be done by means of performance indicators, based on the guideline.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4724" xml_f="4734" txt_i="1514" txt_f="1524">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4745" xml_f="5254" txt_i="1525" txt_f="2034">In this pragmatic trial, effectiveness instead of efficacy is studied.

In the Netherlands, primary care is regularly given by general practitioners  and occupational physicians (OPs). The majority of these OPs are working for commercially operating Occupational Health Services (OHSs). Each Dutch employee has to visit their OP for rehabilitation purposes when they are on sick leave. Therefore, the Dutch OP has a perfect opportunity to play a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of employees with common mental health problems.

Consequently, the approach of Dutch OPs towards employees on sick leave due to mental health problems has been minimal. The usual initial advice given by OPs and GPs towards these patients has been to take rest and only return to work when all complaints have disappeared. When complaints persist, these patients are often referred to psychologists from primary and specialized secondary care. Treatment by these psychologists is mostly symptom based rather than focusing on return to work. Most employees are not insured for these treatments.

The latter mainly concern stress inoculation training and graded activity and aim to enhance the problem-solving capacity of patients in relation to their work environment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19166" xml_f="19912" txt_i="14490" txt_f="15236">The guideline focuses on four aspects of the management of mental health problems. First, an early and activating guidance by the OP is promoted, in which return to work is part of the recovery process, even if the mental health problems are not related to work. Second, a simplified classification of mental health problems is introduced, with only four categories: 1) adjustment disorder (distress, nervous breakdown, burnout), 2) depression, 3) anxiety, and 4) other psychiatric disorders. Third, the OP acts as case manager, who is stimulated to be a care manager by counselling employees with adjustment disorders and work-related problems. Fourth, the OP performs a time contingent process evaluation and intervenes when recovery stagnates.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19919" xml_f="20176" txt_i="15237" txt_f="15494">OPs participating in the study received training in the guideline before the study started.

The course reflected the guideline by training OPs in multiple cognitive-behavioral prescriptive interventions, to stimulate the patients' acquisition of problem solving skills, and to structure the patients' daily activities. Information was given and OPs were trained to differentiate between adjustment disorder and depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders. Questionnaires were introduced, which can be helpful in making an accurate diagnosis. In addition, a graded activity treatment approach was introduced, which was based on a three stages model. This treatment approach resembles stress inoculation training, a highly effective form of cognitive behavioral treatment [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="20939" xml_f="20941" txt_i="16186" txt_f="16188">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20948" xml_f="22025" txt_i="16188" txt_f="17265">]. In the first stage, there is emphasis on information: understanding the origin and cause of the loss of control. Patients are also stimulated to do more non-demanding daily activities. In the second stage, patients are asked to draw up an inventory of stressors and to develop problem solving strategies for the causes of stress. In the third stage, patients put these problem solving strategies into practice and extend their activities to include more demanding ones. The patients' own responsibility and active role in the recovery process was emphasized and the same goes for the importance of an early start of the intervention aimed at the acquisition of coping skills and at regaining control. Problem solving activities according to a time contingent scheme were educated and practiced. The OPs were free to choose the specific tools for use in each phase of the process. The training course was given by four persons: an experienced OP/psychologist, a psychologist/therapist, an experienced general practitioner/researcher on emotional distress, and a psychiatrist.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22047" xml_f="22063" txt_i="17267" txt_f="17283">Co-interventions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22074" xml_f="22727" txt_i="17284" txt_f="17937">Co-interventions cannot always be avoided. In case of post traumatic stress disorders, patients were also referred to a specialized trauma centre according to a special protocol of the DGVP. As the rehabilitation centre DGZ worked with multiple disciplines, it is possible that some patients in the control group received a combined intervention for mental and physical complaints by a psychologist and a physical therapist. In both the intervention and control groups co-interventions were registered in the medical files of the OHS and the database of the DGVP.

Obviously this situation created a risk of treatment contamination between the groups. The trained OP treated an employee in the intervention group according to the guideline, as far as this happens in practice. The same OP treated an employee in the control group with minimal involvement and if applicable, direct referral to a psychologist. A cross-over learning effect may have happened in the control group, since the OP can adhere to the guideline in this group as well. The other way around, the OP may have referred an employee in the intervention group to a psychologist as well. The guideline promotes this in case of stagnation in recovery or in case of severe mental health problems of the employee. However, we tried to maximize the contrast by creating a situation in which referral to the psychologist in the control group was always granted by the insurance company (DGVP).</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24458" xml_f="24474" txt_i="19583" txt_f="19599">Primary outcomes</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24494" xml_f="24508" txt_i="19600" txt_f="19614">Return to work</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="24519" xml_f="24589" txt_i="19615" txt_f="19685">Return to work (RTW) was chosen as the primary outcome in this study [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="24621" xml_f="24623" txt_i="19685" txt_f="19687">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24630" xml_f="24836" txt_i="19687" txt_f="19893">].
