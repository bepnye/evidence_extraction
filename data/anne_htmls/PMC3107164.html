Therefore, it would seem reasonable that frail old hip fracture patients would benefit from comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in the acute setting. Evaluation of efficiency of care pathways for hip fracture patients should emphasise both survival, general function; especially mobility and physical activity, but also quality of life (QoL) and caregiver burden, as well as costs. There is a strong focus in health care management today on the efficient use of limited resources, especially on shortening of length of stay (LOS) and lowering of costs. Furthermore, over the years LOS for patients with hip fracture has declined irrespective of settings and the organizing of health care, indicating that new models of care are less costly than traditional clinical pathways. However, shortening of LOS and reduced emphasis on acute and in-hospital rehabilitation may increase admission rates to nursing homes and reduce the quantity and quality of rehabilitation, and consequently reduce recovery of walking ability and function [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="11090" xml_f="11092" txt_i="5033" txt_f="5035">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11099" xml_f="11100" txt_i="5035" txt_f="5036">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="11132" xml_f="11134" txt_i="5036" txt_f="5038">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11141" xml_f="11180" txt_i="5038" txt_f="5077">] and also shift costs between sectors.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11187" xml_f="11939" txt_i="5078" txt_f="5830">In the present study we aim to investigate whether an alternative clinical pathway for hip fracture patients during the in-hospital acute phase applying CGA in an orthogeriatric ward may improve outcomes in the short (1 and 4 months postoperatively) and long (12 months postoperatively) term without introducing additional specific follow-up programs.
