Outcomes for individuals within the same cluster are often more correlated than outcomes for individuals in different clusters. This needs to be taken into account in sample size estimations for planned trials, but most estimates of intracluster correlation for perinatal health outcomes come from hospital-based studies and may therefore not reflect outcomes in the community.

Estimates of intracluster correlation for maternal mortality were particularly variable with large confidence intervals. Stratified randomisation had the effect of reducing estimates of intracluster correlation. The simulation exercise showed that estimates of intracluster correlation are much less reliable for rare outcomes such as maternal mortality.

Our study confirms previous work finding that estimates of intracluster correlation are associated with the prevalence of the outcome of interest, the nature of the outcome of interest (mortality or behavioural) and the size and number of clusters. Estimates of intracluster correlation for maternal mortality need to be treated with caution and a range of estimates should be used in planning future trials.</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7452" xml_f="7462" txt_i="2474" txt_f="2484">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7473" xml_f="7755" txt_i="2485" txt_f="2767">Public health interventions are increasingly evaluated using cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs) in which groups rather than individuals are allocated randomly to treatment and control arms.

First, many contemporary public health interventions are large in scale, complex in nature, and 'unblinded' in design because they require the active involvement of participants. It is often more appropriate and feasible to implement them 'with' groups or communities rather than to apply them 'to' individuals. Second, cRCTs have the advantage of minimising the risk of contamination that would occur if individuals from the same community were randomised to different treatment arms. Third, cRCTs enable policy-makers and researchers to assess the population-level effects of an intervention applied to a proportion of a population, giving more information about its effectiveness in real life settings. There are now numerous examples of well-conducted public health cRCTs from high, middle and low-income countries. The Mwanza study, for example, tested the impact of improved sexually transmitted infection (STI) case management on the incidence of HIV infection in Mwanza, Tanzania, by randomising 12 pair-matched communities to intervention or control arms [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="8893" xml_f="8894" txt_i="3836" txt_f="3837">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8901" xml_f="9087" txt_i="3837" txt_f="4023">].

Similarity between individuals in the same cluster lessens the variability of responses within clusters (within-cluster variance), thereby artificially magnifying differences in outcomes between clusters and reducing the power of trials to detect true differences between intervention and control arms. An intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) is commonly used to quantify how much more similar outcomes are for individuals within clusters than for those in different clusters [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="10096" xml_f="10097" txt_i="4919" txt_f="4920">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10104" xml_f="10105" txt_i="4920" txt_f="4921">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="10136" xml_f="10137" txt_i="4921" txt_f="4922">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10144" xml_f="10624" txt_i="4922" txt_f="5402">]. The ICC is defined as the ratio of the between-cluster variance to the total variance (both between and within clusters), and therefore has a value between 0 and 1. An ICC of 0 indicates that individuals within clusters are no more similar to each other than individuals from different clusters (there is no between-cluster variability), while an ICC of 1 indicates that individuals within the same cluster all have identical outcomes (there is no within-cluster variability) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="10655" xml_f="10656" txt_i="5402" txt_f="5403">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10663" xml_f="10665" txt_i="5403" txt_f="5405">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10672" xml_f="10746" txt_i="5406" txt_f="5480">The increase in variance due to clustering, or design effect, is given by </offsets><bold><offsets xml_i="10752" xml_f="10754" txt_i="5480" txt_f="5482">1 </offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="10761" xml_f="10764" txt_i="5482" txt_f="5485">+ (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="10772" xml_f="10773" txt_i="5485" txt_f="5486">m</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="10782" xml_f="10783" txt_i="5486" txt_f="5487">-</offsets><bold><offsets xml_i="10789" xml_f="10790" txt_i="5487" txt_f="5488">1</offsets></bold><offsets xml_i="10797" xml_f="10799" txt_i="5488" txt_f="5490">) </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="10807" xml_f="10810" txt_i="5490" txt_f="5493">ICC</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="10819" xml_f="10827" txt_i="5493" txt_f="5501">, where </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="10835" xml_f="10837" txt_i="5501" txt_f="5503">m </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="10846" xml_f="10875" txt_i="5503" txt_f="5532">is the average cluster size [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="10906" xml_f="10907" txt_i="5532" txt_f="5533">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10914" xml_f="11051" txt_i="5533" txt_f="5670">].

For each run of the simulation, we randomly assigned neonatal and maternal outcomes for each cluster by generating random numbers and assigning outcomes according to the assumed mortality rates. By doing this, we made an explicit assumption that the outcomes of births were independent of the outcomes of other births, so that the coefficient of variation, k, for each simulation was identical to zero (individuals within clusters were set to be no more similar to each other than to individuals from different clusters).

Although the comparability of data from the WHO survey and ours is compromised by differences in data collection and outcome ascertainment methods, it is worth noting that the median ICC for neonatal death at hospital discharge or 7 days after delivery was 0.005, and the median ICC for maternal death was 0.003 in the WHO study, while our one-way analysis of variance ICC estimates range from 0.00034 to 0.00247 for neonatal death and from 0 to 0.00051 for maternal death.

First, we drew upon heterogeneous trials with different cluster recruitment strategies and degrees of stratification. These design features need to be taken into consideration when using our ICCs to calculate sample sizes.

Second, ICCs could have been influenced by different reporting preferences in different clusters. For example, some cluster-based key informants or interviewers might have been more adept at reporting or tracking births and deaths than others. Quality of data collection (in terms of both completeness and accuracy) will strongly influence ICCs and is likely to vary between clusters given differences in fieldworkers, terrain and supervision. Finally, we used data from trials with fewer than 40 clusters in their control arms. Donner and Klar advise against overestimating the stability of a sample estimate obtained from a trial involving less than about 40 clusters. The small number of clusters selected would also have increased the confidence intervals around our ICC estimates. We also note that Fisher's method for estimating confidence intervals is unlikely to be strictly valid for the smaller samples used in this study. However, combined, our study offers the largest number of ICCs available to date for perinatal outcomes for community-based samples.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="58293" xml_f="58304" txt_i="38922" txt_f="38933">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="58315" xml_f="59630" txt_i="38934" txt_f="40249">Our study has three main implications. The first relates to the importance of using data drawn from community-based samples when planning effectiveness studies. Mortality estimates from our community-based trials were often substantially different from national DHS estimates and ICCs from our community-based samples in Asia and Africa were lower than those estimated from hospital-based samples in Latin America. This underscores the importance of collecting baseline data to obtain adequate estimates of mortality when planning evaluations of community interventions. Second, our results accord with findings from previous methodological studies regarding the key determinants of the intracluster correlation coefficient: the size of the ICC is related to the prevalence of the outcome of interest, and point estimates of ICC for rare outcomes such as maternal mortality are not likely to be reliable. When planning future trials, published estimates of ICCs from larger clusters are probably safer to use and a range of possible ICCs should be used for sample size calculations. Finally, as maternal and neonatal survival increases and research moves to testing interventions seeking to improve care-seeking or process outcomes, the high ICCs found for these will need to be accounted for in study sample sizes.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="59652" xml_f="59678" txt_i="40251" txt_f="40277">List of Abbreviations used</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="59689" xml_f="60106" txt_i="40278" txt_f="40695">cRCT: Cluster randomised controlled trial; DHS: Demographic and health survey; ICC: Intracluster correlation coefficient ICD: International classification of diseases; MMR: Maternal mortality ratio; NFHS: National family health survey; NMR: Neonatal mortality rate; PCP: Perinatal Care Project; SBA: Skilled birth attendant; SNEHA: Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action; TBA: Traditional birth attendant.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="60128" xml_f="60147" txt_i="40697" txt_f="40716">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="60158" xml_f="60216" txt_i="40717" txt_f="40775">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="60238" xml_f="60260" txt_i="40777" txt_f="40799">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="60271" xml_f="60582" txt_i="40800" txt_f="41111">DO, CP and AP had the original idea for the study.
