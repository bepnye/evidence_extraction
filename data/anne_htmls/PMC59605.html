Clopidogrel is better tolerated than ticlopidine, with far fewer life-threatening side effects (TTP and neutropenia) and minor side effects as well. In addition, the frequency of stent thrombosis when clopidogrel is administered is very low. Whether the frequency of stent thrombosis is as low as, or even lower than, when ticlopidine is administered has not yet been proved beyond a doubt.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18022" xml_f="18920" txt_i="13101" txt_f="13999">However, on the basis of the randomized and registry data and indirect data summarized above, it seems that clopidogrel is at least as efficacious as ticlopidine at preventing stent thrombosis and other adverse ischemic events, and has fewer side effects. If appropriately sized randomized trials were to be performed in the future that found a slight difference in the frequency of stent thrombosis favoring ticlopidine, the difference would undoubtedly be less than the more than 1% frequency of life-threatening neutropenia and TTP seen with ticlopidine administration. Therefore, when considering the risk:benefit ratio of switching from ticlopidine to clopidogrel after stent placement, the driving force is clearly that there is less risk with clopidogrel, rather than a greater benefit with clopidogrel. Whether clopidogrel does provide greater benefit than ticlopidine remains to be proved.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18942" xml_f="18962" txt_i="14001" txt_f="14021">Unanswered questions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18973" xml_f="19227" txt_i="14022" txt_f="14276">Despite TOPPS, several important questions remain unanswered about the use of clopidogrel after stent placement.

Whether the more rapid achievement of platelet inhibition achieved by such large loading doses will improve clinical outcome is unknown.

Peak inhibition of platelet aggregation with even a 300 mg loading dose will still be reached during the infusion of such agents.
