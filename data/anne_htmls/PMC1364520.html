PACE is targeted for adults who are not currently exercising regularly and allows for variation in course content and scheduling. The PACE program is offered at basic and advanced levels. At the basic level, class content consists of range-of-motion, gentle strengthening, balance, weight-bearing, breathing, and endurance exercises at a level appropriate for participants with functional limitations. All exercises can be performed in a standing or seated position to accommodate individuals with different limitations. In addition to exercises, instructors provide education in proper body mechanics, breathing and relaxation techniques, self-management behaviors, body awareness, and exercise principles. These components are included to decrease symptoms such as pain, fatigue, depression, and stress. Instructors are also encouraged to promote self-care and self-esteem using behavioral strategies such as verbal contracting, buddy systems, exercise diaries, and discussion of home exercise problems.

Qualitative analysis allows for exploration of areas that cannot be addressed fully in quantitative studies.

Some participants spoke of wanting to maintain their independence as long as possible, so staying active and learning to move safely was essential. Learning such skills can enhance participants' confidence that they will be able to cope with and adjust to their arthritis.

However, another participant in the same class liked this teaching method, reporting that it made him feel like they "were all learning to exercise together." Lastly, one participant complained that she felt the class was more about socializing than exercising and suggested that the instructor stick to a tighter exercise schedule.

Participant responses, therefore, are specific to the experiences of older adults with arthritis, who may have different expectations for and perceptions of physical activity than younger people with arthritis. Although telephone interviews may have limited the depth of responses to the interview questions, they had the advantage (compared with in-person interviews) of enabling the researchers to contact a large number of participants in a relatively short period. To increase trustworthiness and internal validity, two researchers were involved in the initial data analysis. Both completers and noncompleters from each of the PACE sites were interviewed, thereby reducing potential selection bias.

Because both completers and noncompleters most often remarked upon the importance of support derived from their instructors and class members when talking about their experiences in PACE, the role of social support as a motivating factor to engage in PACE merits further examination. Special attention should be placed on methods of recruiting and training the instructors, as the instructor role was key in sustaining the participants' motivation to exercise. Additionally, a more comprehensive understanding of the participant experiences in PACE could be achieved by analyzing participant demographic characteristics in relation to their qualitative responses. It is likely that factors such as urban or rural residence, functional status, age, and level of education affect a person's expectations and motivation to participate in an arthritis exercise program.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33625" xml_f="34014" txt_i="28508" txt_f="28897">Promoting physical activity is a key public health strategy for addressing arthritis self-management.
