It is associated with the highest mortality rate in low to average-income countries. Breast cancer investigation amongst Iranian women reveals that the number of its incidence is yet the highest in all cancer types. Despite recent longer survival time of women with breast cancer, most of the patients suffer from long term physical and mental distress due to combined treatments. Exercise interventions are among new approaches to promote the better quality of life of the patients, which has only recently been considered by researchers. This study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise intervention on the quality of life of breast cancer survivors.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st2"><title><offsets xml_i="5147" xml_f="5169" txt_i="784" txt_f="806">Materials and Methods:</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5180" xml_f="5822" txt_i="807" txt_f="1449">This is a clinical trial conducted on 80 women with I-III breast cancer, at 18-55 years of age mostly two years after the completion of their treatment in Seyed al Shohada hospital in Isfahan.

Then, they pedaled a magnetic stationary bike, equipped with a LCD showing their heart rate and consumed calorie, for another seven minutes. The intensity of the patients’ exercise was controlled by the maximum heart rate index. Therefore, the patients exercised at 55% of intensity rate for the first two weeks, 65% of intensity for weeks 3-5, and 75% of intensity for weeks 7-8.

First, patients were generally categorized into two groups after treatment, one being those undergoing hormone therapy (Tamocxifen or Aromatase inhibitors, with various side effects such as early menopause, weakness, and etcetera) whose medication had not been controlled as a confounding variable in the present study so that possibly more patients took these medications in the study group compared to the control group and this caused a difference in the physical dimension of QOL of the patients between the two groups. The second factor, which may have made the significant difference in the physical dimension of score of QOL, can be the higher BMI of the subjects in the study group compared to the control group.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20209" xml_f="20357" txt_i="14363" txt_f="14511">The results of the present study showed that the mean score of the mental dimension increased in the study group and decreased in the control group.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20364" xml_f="20549" txt_i="14512" txt_f="14697">Adamsen (2003) showed that despite an increase in the score of the emotional dimension of QOL, this change has not been significant, which is consistent with the results of this study.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15"><offsets xml_i="20583" xml_f="20585" txt_i="14697" txt_f="14699">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20592" xml_f="20593" txt_i="14699" txt_f="14700">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20600" xml_f="20708" txt_i="14701" txt_f="14809">In Headley's study (2004) exercise intervention had very little effect on mental dimension of the patients.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16"><offsets xml_i="20742" xml_f="20744" txt_i="14809" txt_f="14811">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20751" xml_f="20752" txt_i="14811" txt_f="14812">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20759" xml_f="20895" txt_i="14813" txt_f="14949">Milne et al.

The reason for such a difference can be the fact that in the present study, the patients’ treatment had ended and what remained was its bitter memory and complications. Therefore, patients tried to sedate their emotional pain and escape thoughts related to the disease through thinking about spiritual and religious issues. On the other hand, various sport activities with several exercise devices were conducted in this study, as well as those exercises, which could cause a change in the thoughts of patients and lift their spirits.
