By the end of the study, all participants will have received the intervention, although the order in which participants receive the intervention is determined at random. The design is particularly relevant where it is predicted that the intervention will do more good than harm (making a parallel design, in which certain participants do not receive the intervention unethical) and/or where, for logistical, practical or financial reasons, it is impossible to deliver the intervention simultaneously to all participants. Stepped wedge designs offer a number of opportunities for data analysis, particularly for modelling the effect of time on the effectiveness of an intervention. This paper presents a review of 12 studies (or protocols) that use (or plan to use) a stepped wedge design. One aim of the review is to highlight the potential for the stepped wedge design, given its infrequent use to date.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="3753" xml_f="3760" txt_i="1087" txt_f="1094">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3771" xml_f="4086" txt_i="1095" txt_f="1410">Comprehensive literature review of studies or protocols using a stepped wedge design.

In such circumstances, determining the order in which participants receive the intervention at random is likely to be both morally and politically acceptable and may also be beneficial for trial recruitment [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="8382" xml_f="8383" txt_i="5051" txt_f="5052">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8390" xml_f="8619" txt_i="5052" txt_f="5281">]. An example of an intervention where a stepped wedge design may be appropriate in evaluation is a school-based anti-smoking campaign that is delivered by one team of facilitators who travel to each participating school in turn.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8626" xml_f="9545" txt_i="5282" txt_f="6201">It is also important to note that the stepped wedge design is likely to lead to a longer trial duration than a traditional parallel design, particularly where effectiveness is measured immediately after implementation. The design also imposes some practical implementation challenges, such as preventing contamination between intervention participants and those waiting for the intervention and ensuring that those assessing outcomes are blind to the participant's status as intervention or control to help guard against information bias. Blinding assessors is particularly important since it is almost impossible to blind participants or those delivering the intervention, since both will be aware of the 'step' from control to intervention status. As will be shown in this paper, a variety of approaches to statistical analysis have been employed empirically, in part due to the complex nature of the analysis itself.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9552" xml_f="9705" txt_i="6202" txt_f="6355">The potential benefits of employing a stepped wedge design can be illustrated by considering the £20 m evaluation of the Sure Start programme in the UK [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="9736" xml_f="9737" txt_i="6355" txt_f="6356">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9744" xml_f="10254" txt_i="6356" txt_f="6866">]. The Department for Education and Skills ruled out a cluster trial where the deprived areas identified as in need of Sure Start would be randomised to either receive the intervention or act as controls, since to intervene in some areas but not in others was judged unacceptable. The evaluation has instead used a non-randomised control group, consisting of 50 "Sure Start-to-be" communities, compared to the 260 Sure Start intervention communities.

This implementation strategy actually provided an excellent opportunity for a stepped wedge study design, which would have met both ethical and scientific imperatives. Determining the order in which communities received the intervention at random would have been demonstrably impartial and hence a fair way to allocate resources. From the scientific point of view, randomisation would eliminate allocation bias and the stepped wedge deign would have offered a further opportunity to measure possible effects of time of intervention on the effectiveness of the intervention. Since no pre-intervention measurements were undertaken, it was also impossible to separate the effects of the Sure Start programmes from any underlying temporal changes within each community and these effects could also have been investigated through the use of a stepped wedge design.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11265" xml_f="11945" txt_i="7794" txt_f="8474">In this paper, we provide a review of studies employing a stepped wedge design. The review includes studies based on both individual and cluster allocations and is not restricted to RCTs. Indeed, we do not apply any methodological filters. The aim of the review is to determine the extent to which the stepped wedge design has been employed empirically and, for the available studies, to examine the background epidemiology, why researchers decided on a stepped wedge design and methods of data analysis. The review is intended to be systematic and includes trials from all fields.

txt_f="24320">Our review has identified a number of evaluations where a stepped wedge design was clearly appropriate and where the design can provide sound evidence to guide future practice. However not all of the studies included here would fulfil the methodological requirements for a controlled trial and hence we propose that if a stepped wedge design is to be applied, authors should register their trial on the Controlled Clinical Trials Register and follow appropriate reporting guidelines, such as the CONSORT statement or its equivalent for cluster trials [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="38290" xml_f="38292" txt_i="24320" txt_f="24322">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38299" xml_f="38300" txt_i="24322" txt_f="24323">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"><offsets xml_i="38332" xml_f="38334" txt_i="24323" txt_f="24325">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38341" xml_f="38701" txt_i="24325" txt_f="24685">]. A particular concern is with the lack of blinding of those assessing subjective outcomes. This is important given the difficulties associated with blinding participants and those delivering the intervention from their status as intervention or control, since it will nearly always be evident to both groups when the step from control to intervention occurs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38708" xml_f="38992" txt_i="24686" txt_f="24970">The heterogeneity of analytical methods applied in the studies suggests that a formal model considering the effects of time would help others planning a stepped wedge trial and we will present our exposition of such a model in a subsequent paper.

Such time effects can also include seasonal variations and disease progression: the latter may be particularly relevant when evaluating interventions targeting treatments for HIV. Although a traditional parallel trial design can be used to examine general secular trends it cannot explore the particular relationship between time of intervention and effectiveness.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40065" xml_f="40548" txt_i="25992" txt_f="26475">One limitation of our review is the possibility that our search strategy did not identify all of the studies that have employed a stepped wedge design. In particular, we may have missed 'delayed intervention' studies with two steps, in which the delayed group receive the intervention after the outcomes from initial intervention group have been evaluated, but where the outcomes of the delayed group are also evaluated. We have included three studies of this nature in this review [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="40580" xml_f="40582" txt_i="26475" txt_f="26477">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40589" xml_f="40590" txt_i="26477" txt_f="26478">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><offsets xml_i="40622" xml_f="40624" txt_i="26478" txt_f="26480">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40631" xml_f="40632" txt_i="26480" txt_f="26481">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"><offsets xml_i="40664" xml_f="40666" txt_i="26481" txt_f="26483">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40673" xml_f="40910" txt_i="26483" txt_f="26720">] although it is questionable whether studies with only two steps should be considered as stepped wedge designs.

In terms of interventions likely to do more good than harm, a stepped wedge design may be particularly beneficial in evaluating interventions being implemented in a new setting, where evidence for their effectiveness in the original setting is available, or for patient safety interventions that have undergone careful pre-implementation evaluation to rule out any collateral damage. The stepped wedge design may also be appropriate for cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions that have already been shown to be effective. However, the stepped wedge design requires a longer trial duration than parallel designs and also presents a number of challenges, including both practical and statistical complexity. Hence careful planning and monitoring are required in order to ensure that a robust evaluation is undertaken.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="42068" xml_f="42089" txt_i="27774" txt_f="27795">List of Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42100" xml_f="42131" txt_i="27796" txt_f="27827">RCT Randomised Controlled Trial</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="42153" xml_f="42172" txt_i="27829" txt_f="27848">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42183" xml_f="42243" txt_i="27849" txt_f="27909">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="42265" xml_f="42287" txt_i="27911" txt_f="27933">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42298" xml_f="42486" txt_i="27934" txt_f="28122">CB and RL designed the study, CB undertook the literature searching, data extraction and analysis and CB and RL drafted the manuscript.
