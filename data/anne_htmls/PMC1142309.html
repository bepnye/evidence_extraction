Patients in the first two groups were given a packet with their PRIME-MD results, an explanation of these results, a glossary of terms, and a cover letter encouraging them to share their PRIME-MD results with the treating ED physician.

These materials included a one-page cover sheet that introduced the physician to PRIME-MD, reviewed the evidence of its validity, and listed the patient's PRIME-MD diagnoses. As part of the study we produced a list of low-cost and no-cost psychiatric care options that could be offered to patients as part of their after care instructions.

Secondary outcomes were: whether the ED physician made a psychiatric diagnosis and whether the patient actually received follow-up for the psychiatric condition. This information was gleaned from standardized review of the medical record and after care instructions, and follow-up patient telephone interview which took place 2 to 4 weeks after the visit.

Few patients said they told their ED physician about the PRIME-MD results and physicians confirmed that they were seldom told such information. While physicians generally agreed with the PRIME-MD diagnoses, they did not choose to act on them, most commonly because "the visit wasn't about that issue."

Furthermore, treatments for conditions related to the patient's chief complaints (low back pain, general weakness, etc.) have limited efficacy. It would therefore be highly desirable to develop a method for identifying and treating these patients' psychiatric conditions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="31644" xml_f="32491" txt_i="20921" txt_f="21768">The focus groups and this trial suggest that emergency physicians are reluctant to consider psychiatric illness in patients presenting with somatic complaints for reasons such as: discomfort with the content and length of the psychiatric interview, lack of knowledge of diagnostic criteria, lack of interest in the activity, and belief that the activity is futile since the health care system provides few resources for the non-psychotic, underinsured patients who are the most likely target of this intervention. It might be possible to have the computer refer patients directly to providers, thereby bypassing the physicians' resistance, but this could only occur in a system where viable referral options exist. Until such time, it is unlikely that a successful intervention can be developed until readily available follow-up becomes available.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32498" xml_f="33411" txt_i="21769" txt_f="22682">This study took place in a U.S. academic ED within a health care system that provides extremely limited mental health follow-up for underinsured and uninsured patients who are not homicidal, suicidal or floridly psychotic, the majority of patients in our study. Results might be different in a system (such as the U.K.'s) that provides reasonable treatment options for such patients. The inclusion criteria are somewhat subjective. It is quite likely that eligible patients were missed. Furthermore, it is possible that PRIME-MD produced false positive and false negative results. Nevertheless, it is highly unlikely that these selection and misclassification biases would affect our conclusion. The small size of our study makes our estimates imprecise, but not so much so that our conclusions are jeopardized. The poor response rates for physician and patient questionnaires seriously compromises their utility.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33418" xml_f="34513" txt_i="22683" txt_f="23778">We powered the study to look for large effects and cannot comment on whether the use of PRIME-MD produces a modest increase in psychiatric diagnosis and referral in patients with occult psychiatric illness. In retrospect, we might have listened to the focus group participants more carefully. They candidly told us why they were not keen to diagnose and treat these patients. We ignored this and designed an intervention that attempted to use the patients to force their hand. We might have had more success had we organized a follow-up clinic for such patients and directly addressed the physicians' attitudes. We also learned that while the trained undergraduate student research assistants did quite a good job identifying, consenting, and enrolling patients, they were less effective with the physician questionnaire (40% completion rate). We were unrealistic to expect that a junior person could capture the attention of a busy ED resident to get the questionnaire completed. Finally, we might have used block randomization to avoid the imbalance in assignments that occurred in this study.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34535" xml_f="34545" txt_i="23780" txt_f="23790">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34556" xml_f="34871" txt_i="23791" txt_f="24106">In summary, in our ED, telling PRIME-MD diagnoses to the patient (and physician) did not substantially increase the proportion of patients whose were diagnosed and referred for treatment of their psychiatric condition in a health care system that offered extremely limited follow-up possibilities for such patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34893" xml_f="34912" txt_i="24108" txt_f="24127">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34923" xml_f="35132" txt_i="24128" txt_f="24337">The study was funded in part by an unrestricted gift from the Pfizer Corporation.
