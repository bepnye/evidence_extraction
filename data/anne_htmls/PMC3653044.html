However, because each study examined a small set of cues, often in a unique paradigm, the relative efficacy of different sensory contextual cues is unclear. In the present study we quantify how seven contextual cues, some investigated previously and some novel, affect the formation and recall of motor memories. Subjects made movements in a velocity-dependent curl field, with direction varying randomly from trial to trial but always associated with a unique contextual cue. Linking field direction to the cursor or background color, or to peripheral visual motion cues, did not reduce interference. In contrast, the orientation of a visual object attached to the hand cursor significantly reduced interference, albeit by a small amount. When the fields were associated with movement in different locations in the workspace, a substantial reduction in interference was observed. We tested whether this reduction in interference was due to the different locations of the visual feedback (targets and cursor) or the movements (proprioceptive). When the fields were associated only with changes in visual display location (movements always made centrally) or only with changes in the movement location (visual feedback always displayed centrally), a substantial reduction in interference was observed. These results show that although some visual cues can lead to the formation and recall of distinct representations in motor memory, changes in spatial visual and proprioceptive states of the movement are far more effective than changes in simple visual contextual cues.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>motor learning</kwd><kwd>visual cues</kwd><kwd>interference</kwd><kwd>dynamic adaptation</kwd><kwd>state-dependent learning</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><sc><offsets xml_i="5169" xml_f="5201" txt_i="1724" txt_f="1756">during interactions with objects</offsets></sc><offsets xml_i="5206" xml_f="5312" txt_i="1756" txt_f="1862"> in the environment, our sensorimotor control system uses sensory information to adapt to novel dynamics (</offsets><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="5344" xml_f="5366" txt_i="1862" txt_f="1884">Lackner and Dizio 1994</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5373" xml_f="5375" txt_i="1884" txt_f="1886">; </offsets><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="5407" xml_f="5437" txt_i="1886" txt_f="1916">Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi 1994</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5444" xml_f="5657" txt_i="1916" txt_f="2129">).

Such differences in experimental design include the number of targets, the form and strength of the dynamic force fields, the ordering of trials, the use of arm movements vs. elbow movements, and the length of the movements. In particular, some studies have examined only a single movement direction (e.g., </offsets><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8460" xml_f="8485" txt_i="3997" txt_f="4022">Hirashima and Nozaki 2012</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8492" xml_f="8494" txt_i="4022" txt_f="4024">; </offsets><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8526" xml_f="8543" txt_i="4024" txt_f="4041">Hwang et al. 2006</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8550" xml_f="8977" txt_i="4041" txt_f="4468">), which raises a possible problem, since cognitive strategies may be easier to use for a single movement direction. There are also conflicting reports of the behavior of some cues in the literature. In particular, the effectiveness of color as a contextual cue for learning opposing dynamics is controversial.

In the study, participants made movements to two possible targets, one to the left and the other to the right of straight ahead. However, by associating a counterclockwise and a clockwise visuomotor rotation of the hand cursor with trials to the left and right targets, it was possible to get the subjects to make the same physical movement (i.e., straight ahead) to achieve different visual movements to the two targets. When each target was associated with a different field, participants could learn the opposing dynamics on the basis of the differences in visual feedback despite the movements being in the same physical space.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10687" xml_f="12558" txt_i="5855" txt_f="7726">In the present study we use an interference paradigm to investigate the relative effectiveness of different contextual cues and changes in state, some of which have been investigated previously and some of which are novel. We distinguish state changes from contextual cues, with the latter referring to sensory information unrelated to the state of the arm. Therefore, cues can include features such as the background color or visual orientation of a handheld object. In contrast, state changes can include different configurations of the arm, whether real or perceived. However, it is possible for state changes to be investigated within the same framework as that used for sensory contextual cue, thereby unifying these conditions within the same experimental paradigm. Therefore, for convenience, we refer to the different experimental conditions, be they sensory cues or states, as contextual cues. Our unified interference paradigm ensures that each interference experiment differs only in terms of the contextual cue, with all other experimental features remaining consistent across experiments. This allows us to assess and rank their ability in the formation and recall of distinct motor memories. Subjects performed center-out reaching movements to eight targets in which one of two opposing curl force fields was applied. The direction of the curl field was consistent with a contextual cue, which was presented both before and during the movement. This paradigm was used to contrast the effectiveness of seven contextual cues: cursor color, background color, peripheral visual motion, object orientation, pure visual offset, pure movement offset, and workspace offset. Whereas some of these conditions have been studied previously, albeit many using only a single direction of movement, the peripheral visual motion and object orientation are novel conditions.</offsets></p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><offsets xml_i="12603" xml_f="12624" txt_i="7727" txt_f="7748">MATERIALS AND METHODS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="12635" xml_f="13009" txt_i="7749" txt_f="8123">A total of 48 (22 male, 26 female) right-handed subjects, mean age 22.7 (SD 5.2) yr old, took part in 8 experiments (6 subjects in each experiment).

However, these studies examined a single or a small set of cues, each often using a unique paradigm, with different task parameters and movement numbers, making quantitative comparisons between the results difficult. In the present study we used an interference task to undertake a systematic investigation of the contextual effects of seven cues along with a pure control condition. This enabled us to quantify them in terms their ability to form distinct motor memories to opposing dynamics. A specific contextual cue was associated with each of two opposing force fields. The amount of learning was examined by using the reduction in kinematic error and increase in force compensation during the exposure trials, as well as the size of aftereffects (in both kinematic error and force) during the postexposure trials. We found dramatic differences in the efficacy of these sensory contextual cues. Our results show that although some visual cues, such as color, have little or no effect, other cues, such as changes in spatial visual and proprioceptive states of the movement, are far more effective and can lead to the formation and recall of distinct representations in motor memory.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="61995" xml_f="62950" txt_i="47217" txt_f="48172">The results demonstrated that changes in color (of either the cursor or background), while able to slightly but significantly reduce kinematic error during the field exposure, did not result in changes in endpoint force or aftereffects.

That is, a slight reduction in MPE was observed during field exposure, with no accompanying changes in endpoint force or aftereffects. Although reduction in kinematic error is often assumed to indicate adaptation to dynamics, our results indicate that subjects did not form a force field-specific motor memory of the two dynamics, since the latter would have produced force compensation and aftereffects.

However, in this previous study, the visual motion was motion of the subject's cursor directly prior to movement in the force field. The direction of the cursor movement was predictive of the directionality of the force field experienced in the subsequent movement. From the current work it can be seen that an arbitrary visual motion cue does not produce such contextual effects even when it is uniquely associated with the force field direction. Here we investigated whether peripheral background movement within the workspace could act as a contextual cue by employing movement of disks around the periphery of the workspace. Such motion did not lead to context-dependent learning. Together, these results suggest that visual movement needs to be more closely associated with the task, or even be considered part of it by the motor system, for it to have a strong contextual effect. It remains to be determined exactly how closely associated the visual motion needs to be to the task, but it is clear that any arbitrary motion cannot be used to learn independent motor memories.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="67544" xml_f="67672" txt_i="52089" txt_f="52217">Previous studies have shown that subjects can use visual information to identify the location of the center of mass of objects (</offsets><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="67703" xml_f="67728" txt_i="52217" txt_f="52242">Bingham and Muchisky 1993</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="67735" xml_f="67835" txt_i="52242" txt_f="52342">).

Therefore, there are a large number of studies demonstrating that the sensorimotor control system uses visual information of objects to determine the appropriate motor memory to use for control. Such studies motivated us to examine whether the addition of a visual object connected to the cursor could be associated with different dynamics. In particular we chose two arbitrary objects, matched in size, with no direct relation with the associated forces with either force field (considering all 8 directions of motion). Using this arbitrary association, we demonstrated that linking the field direction to the orientation of a visual object attached to the cursor significantly reduced interference, albeit by a small amount. Thus the orientation of an asymmetric cursor has a small but significant contextual effect, suggesting that the visual representation of an object can have a direct effect on the formation and recall of motor memories. However, we note that the asymmetric cursor condition exhibits some similarity to the visual offset condition, although its effects are much weaker. In both of these experiments the location of visual feedback was context dependent and offset to either the left or the right of the central home position. Thus, in the object orientation experiment, there may also exhibit some contextual effect due to differences in visual state of the cursor.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="69685" xml_f="69852" txt_i="54030" txt_f="54197">It has been suggested that the learning of dynamics occurs by representing the command necessary to compensate for the dynamics as a function of the state of the arm (</offsets><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="69884" xml_f="69914" txt_i="54197" txt_f="54227">Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi 1994</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="69921" xml_f="70285" txt_i="54227" txt_f="54591">).

In contrast, when only the visual task location was different for the two fields, there was significantly more interference between the two tasks. The combined visual and proprioceptive shift is a state change, and the purely visual or purely proprioceptive shifts could be interpreted as either a cue or state change.

However, our experimental results show that learning of opposing dynamics on the basis of contextual cues in the form of visual offsets can be achieved in multiple movement directions and without the need for a gradual introduction of the visual offset.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="73854" xml_f="75018" txt_i="57947" txt_f="59111">Overall, our findings indicate that more abstract aspects of vision, such as color, have a weaker, if any, effect on dynamic learning in the motor system than other visual aspects of the environment (such as object orientation), which may correlate more strongly with required changes in motor behavior. However, the strongest effects in this study were found for conditions in which the state space was sufficiently different between the two fields (through either visual or proprioceptive differences in state). We suggest that this difference may arise not simply because the different workspace cues are more salient, but because the motor memories are learned as a function of the state of the limbs. Because both visual and proprioceptive information can be used by the sensorimotor control system to estimate the limb state, distinct sensory cues from visual and proprioceptive modalities will influence the state space in which the novel dynamics are learned. We propose therefore that these differences illustrate a conceptual difference between two types of cue. First, subjects can learn to associate arbitrary sensory cues (e.g., object orientation in </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="75026" xml_f="75038" txt_i="59111" txt_f="59123">experiment 5</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="75047" xml_f="75973" txt_i="59123" txt_f="60049">) with different dynamics, but this effect takes substantial time and appears a weak cue. Second, sensory cues that dissociate the visual or proprioceptive state of the arm may automatically alter the neural coding of the movement so as to allow separate motor memories to be learned rapidly. We hypothesize that this distinction arises because dynamics can be represented in terms of the state of the limb, and modification of the proprioceptive or visual feedback of the limb will alter the estimated state. In contrast, other cues require associative learning to map the sensory cue with the appropriate internal model of the dynamics for both recall (before movement) and error assignment (during and after the motion) to produce an effect. This is because they have little a priori influence to the motor system. Indeed, the size weight illusion demonstrates this: it can be reversed, but only with substantial training (</offsets><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="76004" xml_f="76024" txt_i="60049" txt_f="60069">Flanagan et al. 2008</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="76031" xml_f="76033" txt_i="60069" txt_f="60071">).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="76040" xml_f="76734" txt_i="60072" txt_f="60766">In conclusion, we have shown that sensory contextual information can play a fundamental role in reducing interference and lead to the formation of separate motor memories for distinct dynamics. Our study has enabled us to rank the effectiveness of seven such contextual cues by using a standardized protocol across all experimental conditions. The results demonstrate that different aspects of sensory information provide better contextual cues than others, with conditions that could influence the estimated limb state having the strongest effects. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of state-dependent sensory information in the formation and recall of independent motor memories.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="76756" xml_f="76762" txt_i="60768" txt_f="60774">GRANTS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="76773" xml_f="76853" txt_i="60775" txt_f="60855">We thank the Wellcome Trust and the Human Frontiers Science Program for support.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="76875" xml_f="76886" txt_i="60857" txt_f="60868">DISCLOSURES</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="76897" xml_f="77035" txt_i="60869" txt_f="61007">The authors declare that they have no financial, personal, or professional interests that could be construed to have influenced the paper.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="77057" xml_f="77077" txt_i="61009" txt_f="61029">AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="77088" xml_f="77461" txt_i="61030" txt_f="61403">I.S.H., D.M.W., and D.W.F. conception and design of research; I.S.H. performed experiments; I.S.H. and D.W.F. analyzed data; I.S.H., D.M.W., and D.W.F. interpreted results of experiments; I.S.H. and D.W.F. prepared figures; I.S.H. drafted manuscript; I.S.H., D.M.W., and D.W.F. edited and revised manuscript; I.S.H., D.M.W., and D.W.F. approved final version of manuscript.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank Sae Franklin for assistance with the experiments.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
