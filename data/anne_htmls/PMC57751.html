In the Framework practices, patients with suspected or definite LEAD were identified either through diagnostic indices or through a listing of those taking any medications that may be used in treating LEAD and its complications. The research nurses then reviewed the notes of all of these men in order to exclude those who did not in fact have LEAD. Men with LEAD were ineligible for the following reasons: unstable angina, unless or until it was controlled; serum total cholesterol less than 3.5 mmol/l or more than 8.0 mmol/l (discussed in further detail below); significant renal or hepatic disease; a known hepatitis B or C or HIV positive status; malignant disease (other than non-melanoma skin cancer) within the past 5 years; they were taking or likely to need lipid-lowering agents or monamine oxidase inhibitors; they were unlikely to comply with trial treatment or procedures; they were in another trial; or at the discretion of the general practitioner for other reasons.

Occasional atypical responses, such as pain on walking in the thigh or buttock, but not in the calf, were assessed by the doctor, although LEAD was confirmed at a second visit for a medical examination by the doctor in all cases, typical or not. Blood was drawn to identify those with lipid levels that the general practitioner might wish to treat with non-fibrate agents, or those with evidence of renal impairment defined in these men (on expert advice) as serum creatinine of 150 μmol/l or more, because both of these situations increase the risk of muscle necrosis in those taking bezafibrate.

The question most frequently raised before final approval was given was whether men should routinely be taking statins, largely regardless of cholesterol levels, but particularly in those with high levels and those who had previously had myocardial infarcts. When the trial began, it was clear that expense would often preclude this, although participation in the trial would at least provide a 50% chance of receiving lipid-modifying treatment. Thus, after verbal and/or written exchanges with several committees, the entry criteria were accepted. As a matter of principle, no advice was given to the doctors responsible for the day-to-day management of recruited patients regarding treatments outside the requirements of the trial.

General practitioners and hospital doctors were also given pre-treatment cholesterol levels so that they could initiate statin treatment before trial treatment started if they wished to do so, and they were also notified regarding raised levels at follow-up visits. In 1999, the data monitoring and ethics committee of the trial recommended that reminder letters should be sent to doctors caring for all trial patients with total cholesterol levels above 7.0 mmol/l, which resulted in several men being started on statin treatment and their withdrawal from trial treatment.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="15045" xml_f="15085" txt_i="11555" txt_f="11595">Follow up and ascertainment of endpoints</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="15096" xml_f="16004" txt_i="11596" txt_f="12504">Men were seen 1 month after treatment started and then at 3-month intervals to receive new supplies of tablets.

At the annual visits, nurses asked about possible endpoint events (ie myocar-dial infarction and stroke). Details regarding such events were mostly provided by the Framework practices as they occurred, but were also sought at an annual check through the practice notes for each patient.

Active treatment led to a sustained reduction in total cholesterol of approximately 8%. There was an unexplained downward 'drift' in LDL-cholesterol levels in the laboratory that analysed the samples, which is reflected in the placebo group (and in all of the hospital's routine clinical samples analysed in the laboratory concerned). Nevertheless, the effect of active treatment in raising HDL-cholesterol can be seen, although the difference declined from 10.6 to 6.2% over the 3 years. There may have been a small increase in absolute LDL-cholesterol levels as a result of the drift in HDL-cholesterol (because the calculated difference method has been used for LDL-cholesterol), but the sustained difference between the two groups represents a reduction of approximately 9% in LDL-cholesterol at 3 years attributable to active treatment. There was also a substantial reduction in triglyceride levels, as expected.

Perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, entry values of fibrinogen and lipids were not grossly abnormal, entry fibrinogen and (non-fasting) triglyceride values being only moderately raised.

The proportion of patients who withdrew from randomised treatment was higher than was assumed in our estimation of the required sample size. However, extending the duration of participation for men recruited early on has to some extent offset the effect of this difference, and many withdrawals occurred after several years of participation in the trial. Thus, even at 3 years, some 80% of the person-years accrued in the trial were spent on randomly assigned treatment.

The contrast between the fibrinogen-lowering effect of bezafibrate and the absence of any effect on CRP is clear. CRP is a particularly sensitive index of inflammatory processes. Thus, it appears that the effect of bezafi-brate on fibrinogen is independent at any rate of this index of inflammation, suggesting that any benefit due to bezafi-brate on fibrinogen levels may not be mediated simply through a reduction in inflammatory stimuli.

There has been a sustained reduction in plasma fibrinogen that would also be expected to be beneficial. There is, however, no clear effect of treatment on CRP. Thus, any benefit due to bezafibrate on fibrinogen may not be mediated simply through a reduction in inflammatory stimuli.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="47038" xml_f="47057" txt_i="33023" txt_f="33042">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47068" xml_f="47082" txt_i="33043" txt_f="33057">None declared.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="47104" xml_f="47117" txt_i="33059" txt_f="33072">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47128" xml_f="47354" txt_i="33073" txt_f="33299">CHD = coronary heart disease; CRP = C-reactive protein; HDL = high-density lipoprotein; LDL = low-density lipoprotein; LEAD = lower extremity arterial disease; LEADER = Lower Extremity Arterial Disease Event Reduction (trial).</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The trial was funded mainly by the Medical Research Council and also by the British Heart Foundation.
