A comparison of study patients with admissions to hospital in the 2007 UK audit of AUGIB (a cross-sectional audit of 208 UK hospitals) suggests similar mean ages (59.4 vs 62.6 years), gender (60.5% male vs 60% male), median presenting haemoglobin (11.9 vs 11.4 g/dL), median Rockall Score (2 vs 2), aetiology of bleeding and median hospital stay (4 vs 5 days).</offsets><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="56950" xml_f="56952" txt_i="28831" txt_f="28833">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="56959" xml_f="57916" txt_i="28833" txt_f="29790"> In-hospital mortality for new presentations in the 2007 audit, however, was double that observed in the TRIGGER trial (6.8% vs 3.4%). This observation may be attributable to a number of reasons: first, TRIGGER excluded patients with exsanguinating bleeding, a group associated with greater mortality; and second, improvements in care, namely, better access to emergency endoscopy than that was present in the nationwide audit in 2007. It must also be acknowledged that the incidence figures for AUGIB in the UK used in this study when estimating national costs include a proportion (16%) of patients already hospitalised when developing a bleed. Although the incremental cost of treatment for these patients was not calculated here (the TRIGGER trial included only patients presenting to hospital), analyses assuming costs for this subgroup of patients were 50% higher and 50% lower than those observed here, altered the national cost estimates by just 8%.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="57923" xml_f="58367" txt_i="29791" txt_f="30229">Knowledge of key cost drivers in the treatment of AUGIB can enable healthcare providers to identify avenues for cost reduction and be a point of reference for cost-effectiveness research. For example, a large UK study has shown that more timely endoscopy for AUGIB (&lt;12 vs &gt;12 h postpresentation) can reduce hospital inpatient stay (shown here to be responsible for 60% of in-hospital costs for this population) by an average of 1.7 days.</offsets><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="58399" xml_f="58401" txt_i="30229" txt_f="30231">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="58408" xml_f="58956" txt_i="30231" txt_f="30779"> Any cost savings brought about via a reduction in hospital stay would, however, need to be offset against the cost of additional resources required to facilitate more rapid access to endoscopy and to be considered alongside any potential impact on patient outcomes. Similarly, the TRIGGER feasibility trial reported a trend towards improved safety with a restrictive RBC transfusion policy and observed a reduction in the mean number of RBC units transfused from 1.91 under a liberal policy to 1.21 (mean difference 0.7 units, 95% CI −1.6 to 0.3).</offsets><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="58987" xml_f="58988" txt_i="30779" txt_f="30780">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="58995" xml_f="59062" txt_i="30780" txt_f="30847"> Using these findings together with the national cost estimates in </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014007230TB3"><offsets xml_i="59112" xml_f="59119" txt_i="30847" txt_f="30854">table 3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="59126" xml_f="59726" txt_i="30854" txt_f="31454"> and assuming that half of the patients with AUGIB in the UK are already exposed to a restrictive transfusion policy, changing practice for the remaining 50% of patients could potentially save 20 102 units of RBCs, which at a cost of £123.31 per unit amounts to savings of £2.48 million; however, even this may be an underestimate because the percentage of hospitals currently using a restrictive policy is likely to be less than 50%.
