Theoretically, the infusion could take place at home, rather than in hospital. Findings from other patient populations suggest that patients may find the experiences of home relapse management more desirable. However, formal comparison of these two settings, from the patients' point of view, was prevented by the lack of a clinical scale. We report the development of a rating scale to measure patient's experiences of relapse management that allowed this question to be answered confidently.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4496" xml_f="4503" txt_i="613" txt_f="620">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4514" xml_f="4970" txt_i="621" txt_f="1077">Scale development had three stages.

It is therefore important to extend this model to the use of IVMP for disabling MS relapses, so that a clear policy decision can be made: hospital or community? Whilst it is likely that home administration of IVMP may be more suitable from the patients' perspective, a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is required to compare the health care experiences in these settings. Yet, to do this an explicit and valid outcome measure to quantify patients' experiences of relapse management is needed as the primary outcome. Although patient "satisfaction" ratings are often used as outcome measures when evaluating medical care from the patients' perspective, they have limitations. Typically, they result in very positive ratings that do not discriminate between people, and are insensitive to specific problems in care delivery [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="7742" xml_f="7743" txt_i="3461" txt_f="3462">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7750" xml_f="8252" txt_i="3462" txt_f="3964">]. This is probably because "satisfaction" is an ill-defined term. It is more useful clinically, to refine the measurement of patients' experiences by quantifying the main aspects of relapse management that people with MS find important. Ratings on these variables can then be compared across different treatments. This article reports the development of a rating scale measuring the essential aspects of patients' experiences in MS relapse management, to be used in a trial of delivery of IV steroids.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="8293" xml_f="8300" txt_i="3966" txt_f="3973">Methods</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8320" xml_f="8328" txt_i="3974" txt_f="3982">Overview</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8339" xml_f="8857" txt_i="3983" txt_f="4501">The scale was developed in three stages.

Second, to generate a pool of items that would eventually attempt to manifest each of these components as a rating scale. In practice, this was an iterative process in which different ideas about the key components, and how the items might be grouped were considered and integrated. This process continued until items were grouped under the most clinically appropriate component and a preliminary questionnaire was produced.

Full details are available from the authors. However, in brief, data quality was high (there were few missing data) implying that the scales can be completed successfully, and that the items are relevant, and not confusing or upsetting to people. Tests of scaling assumptions were satisfied, implying that the items in each subscale can be summed to produce a single subscale score. Subscale scores were well targeted to the sample indicating that this was an adequate sample of people with MS in which to examine the measurement properties of the MSRMS. All indicators of reliability exceeded recommended criteria, indicating that the total scores for each subscale were reliable estimates. The pattern and magnitude of correlations between the four MSRMS subscales and other rating scales (MSIS-29, MSWS-12, SF-36, EDSS), and MSRMS correlations with age and disease duration were consistent with a priori hypothesis. These findings provide evidence to support the validity of the MSRMS as they imply that the four MSRMS subscales were measuring related but distinct constructs, were unrelated to age and disease duration, and were measuring concepts distinct from those measured by the other rating scales.</offsets></p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26957" xml_f="27014" txt_i="17038" txt_f="17095">Stage 3: Psychometric evaluation of the MSRMS: RCT sample</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="27025" xml_f="27176" txt_i="17096" txt_f="17247">Six patients had missing data at 6 weeks follow-up and were excluded from analysis.

However, the aim of the item generation stage was to be as inclusive of a wide range of patients' views as possible (inpatient, outpatient and home).
