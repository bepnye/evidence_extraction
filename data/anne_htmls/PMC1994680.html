The PCTs supplied the prescribing data and, to enable us to identify the intervention and control practices for analysis, codes were developed and used by the PCTs to mark data accordingly. A letter was sent to every GP in the district outlining the study, informing them that anonymous, aggregated PACT data were being used for analysis, and assuring them of confidentiality. A representative from the clinical effectiveness unit and the PCTs each signed this letter. Because patients were not directly involved, and no patient identifiable data were to be included in the final analysis, a formal application to the local ethics committee was, on enquiry, deemed unnecessary.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18736" xml_f="18743" txt_i="14037" txt_f="14044">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18754" xml_f="19131" txt_i="14045" txt_f="14422">All 73 practices in Newcastle and North Tyneside were invited into the study.

Additionally, these are data that are routinely fed back to all GPs as part of the PACT data within the standard method of informing their prescribing practice. It is unlikely that the study was not long enough. Depression is a common condition managed in primary care. Even after allowing for cases of mild depression, for whom drug treatment would not be indicated, a full-time GP could expect to see approximately 18 new patients with depression over a 12 month period. Therefore, there should have been several opportunities to decide to prescribe differently. However, while such an incidence rate should of itself be sufficient to find an effect, the fact that this effect becomes much smaller when considered within the overall prescribing for all cases of both incident and prevalent depression means that we may have failed to detect an effect.

Anecdotally, the pharmaceutical advisers reported that during the visits GPs frequently commented that for a proportion of patients they were merely continuing a drug (usually an SSRI) on the advice of secondary care following referral.
