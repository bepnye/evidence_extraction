However, altering empiric therapy recommendations to either nitrofurantoin or fluoroquinolone antibiotics, without information on local resistance patterns, may result in unnecessary increases in health care expenditures due to increased drug costs.

QOL did not differ between these groups at baseline and 28 days. This indicates all patients were experiencing significant decreases in QOL at baseline.

However, QOL did differ significantly at baseline between patients with positive and negative urine cultures. One possible explanation for this difference is that patients with culture negative cystitis are more sensitive to the impact of cystitis symptoms on their QOL compared to those with positive urine cultures. That is to say that while their urine culture was negative, the urinary symptoms they were experiencing had a greater impact on QOL compared with patients that have a higher overall QOL. Alternatively, patients with culture negative cystitis may differ in some other way that impacts their QOL compared to patients with culture positive cystits.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27185" xml_f="27309" txt_i="17633" txt_f="17757">We did not find any significant difference between the drug treatments on patients' QOL throughout the study period (figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5"><offsets xml_i="27339" xml_f="27340" txt_i="17757" txt_f="17758">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27347" xml_f="27638" txt_i="17758" txt_f="18049">).

We have shown that even common side effects of antibiotics such as gastrointestinal effects have a negative impact on patients QOL. While some difference was observed in the rate of adverse events reported between treatment groups, this difference did not reach statistical significance. We also found that patients reporting adverse events had lower QOL throughout the study period, including baseline and at 28 days. This may suggest that patients with lower overall QOL may be more sensitive to the addition of drug therapy to their daily routine. The potential for patients having lower QOL reporting more adverse events has not been previously described. This information along with our findings that patients with negative urine cultures also have lower QOL suggests certain patients experience greater impacts on their QOL from seemingly innocuous occurrences such as urinary symptoms of cystitis or taking antibiotics compared to other patients. It is possible that health care providers may need to approach diagnosis and treatment in these patients differently from other patients. More care may be necessary in evaluating symptoms and laboratory information to decide whether treatment is necessary and more care may be needed in drug therapy selection, for example.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="29200" xml_f="29210" txt_i="19507" txt_f="19517">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29221" xml_f="29560" txt_i="19518" txt_f="19857">In summary, we have found that patients experiencing cystitis have significant decreases in QOL and that QOL is improved by effective treatment.
