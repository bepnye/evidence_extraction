There are no local guidelines to related to the content of the postpartum visit and there is great variability among physicians in terms of the issues that are addressed during that visit. Infants are usually seen at 1 - 2 months of life for the first well baby visit. The visit usually includes vaccinations, a physical exam with focus on growth and development, as well as anticipatory guidance for the parents. There are currently no community services that provide social or medical support to new mothers or their infants outside of the routine medical visits. Women seeking answers to their questions related to self-care or newborn care in the postpartum period usually rely on their social network or call their physicians for answers. Mothers who depend on their social network can be confused by the conflicting or inaccurate information they receive. When women depend on their physicians for answers, the increased workload of responding to telephone calls can be a burden.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9271" xml_f="10123" txt_i="4849" txt_f="5701">We were interested in establishing a hotline for postpartum support for first-time mothers in an attempt to reduce the stress associated with that phase of life. However, the low utilization of existing hotlines and concerns about whether women would trust the information provided by such a service lead us to question whether women would utilize the hotline as a source of information. This study was conducted in preparation for a larger trial designed to evaluate the impact of different interventions on reducing stress in the postpartum for healthy first-time mothers with healthy infants. The purpose of this study was to examine the utilization of a hotline dedicated to postpartum support by first-time mothers in Lebanon. Our aim was to clarify usage patterns and the types of questions asked as well as the perceived value of such a service.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="10164" xml_f="10171" txt_i="5703" txt_f="5710">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10182" xml_f="10662" txt_i="5711" txt_f="6191">The study targeted first-time mothers delivering in hospitals throughout Lebanon.

The service was free of charge. Mothers were asked to send a text message or call the hotline and hang up after the first ring and a certified midwife would return their call within ten minutes. Mothers using the hotline could identify themselves by using their unique ID number. Study participants were neither encouraged nor discouraged from sharing the hotline number with other women.

The algorithms were designed to allow the midwife to answer questions in a consistent manner based on the best available scientific evidence. In a setting where different people may answer the hotline, algorithms can provide consistency in responses and ensure that all questions are answered based on best evidence. Our algorithms were developed using a combination of medical journals, medical textbooks and expert opinion. A total of 17 algorithms related to baby care and 12 algorithms related to the mother were developed. These included topics such as infant feeding and elimination, baby blues and postpartum depression, contraception and resumption of menstruation. The midwife was given the algorithms in a folder and trained to use them. She was also trained on data collection and handling of telephone calls using role-play techniques. All medical complaints were referred to the patient's physician, and no diagnosis or treatment were given through the hotline.

Budgeting and cost calculations should include a telephone line and one nurse or midwife. However, if a hotline is planned to cover a larger population of women, management of the service would need to be planned based on expected call volumes. Seigel and colleagues note from their study on a maternity in California that with time the number of calls grew to exceed three times the number of deliveries [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="26998" xml_f="26999" txt_i="18165" txt_f="18166">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27006" xml_f="27121" txt_i="18166" txt_f="18281">].

To justify the allocation of resources to provide such a service, governments or hospitals would need data to support that this hotline improves outcomes such as breastfeeding success or the health and wellbeing of parents or their infants. Our experience demonstrates that hospitals can provide this service to their patients without adding a significant workload to nurses. Nurses on duty can answer questions, and algorithms can be used to standardize answers. We found the utilization rate of the hotline high enough to justify including it as an intervention on our randomized trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28424" xml_f="28443" txt_i="19452" txt_f="19471">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28454" xml_f="28512" txt_i="19472" txt_f="19530">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28534" xml_f="28556" txt_i="19532" txt_f="19554">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28567" xml_f="28763" txt_i="19555" txt_f="19751">The study was conceived by all authors.
