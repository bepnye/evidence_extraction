txt_f="1183">Activation of inflammatory pathways plays an important contributory role in coronary plaque instability and subsequent rupture, which can lead to the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Elevated levels of serum inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) represent independent risk factors for further cardiovascular events. Recent evidence indicates that in addition to lowering cholesterol levels, statins also decrease levels of inflammatory markers. Previous controlled clinical trials reporting the positive effects of statins in participants with ACS were designed for very early secondary prevention. To our knowledge, no controlled trials have evaluated the potential benefits of statin therapy, beginning immediately at the time of hospital admission. A previous pilot study performed by our group focused on early initiation of cerivastatin therapy. We demonstrated a highly significant reduction in levels of inflammatory markers (CRP and interleukin-6). Based on these preliminary findings, we are conducting a clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of another statin, fluvastatin, as an early intervention in patients with ACS.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="8158" xml_f="8165" txt_i="1185" txt_f="1192">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8176" xml_f="8886" txt_i="1193" txt_f="1903">The FACS-trial (Fluvastatin in the therapy of Acute Coronary Syndrome) is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of fluvastatin therapy initiated at the time of hospital admission.

It was found that traditional risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking could not fully account for the development of coronary stenosis in all patients suffering from ischemic heart disease. Intensive study of the pathogenesis of coronary plaque development and rupture led to the hypothesis that inflammatory factors contribute to this process. For example, T-lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages have been repeatedly identified in plaque lesions; elevated levels of acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, fibrinogen), cytokines (interleukin 1, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, tumor necrosis factor), and adhesive molecules (ICAM-1) correlate with the worse prognoses in patients with ischemic heart disease [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="10565" xml_f="10566" txt_i="3261" txt_f="3262">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10573" xml_f="10574" txt_i="3262" txt_f="3263">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="10605" xml_f="10606" txt_i="3263" txt_f="3264">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10613" xml_f="10878" txt_i="3264" txt_f="3529">].
