Interpretation of EPS data is complicated further by the use of different adjunctive antiparkinsonian medications that aim to ameliorate EPS. Therefore, in clinical and research settings, the presence of a movement disorder is typically assessed with different measures, each focusing on somewhat different aspects of the disorder. Results of patients’ risk of movement disorder are reported for each measure individually, thus not providing a single overall composite parameter that can inform clinicians of the overall severity level of a patient’s movement disorder, if present. A systematic and comprehensive method for assessing EPS and an index to capture several aspects of EPS, as assessed by various measures, while also incorporating the use of adjunctive antiparkinsonian medications, is needed. This could allow better assessment and more precise evaluation of the effects of antipsychotic medications on EPS and help identify subgroups of patients with a greater liability for EPS.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9106" xml_f="9733" txt_i="5021" txt_f="5648">The objectives of this study were to develop a new index measure of movement disorder and evaluate its potential utility by identifying subgroups of patients with schizophrenia who differed on their movement disorder profile over a one-year period and compare their clinical and functional outcomes to determine if this movement disorder profile is related to treatment outcome.
