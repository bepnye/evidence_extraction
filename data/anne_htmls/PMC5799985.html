Premature loss can cause various problems such as ectopic eruption, space loss for the successor permanent teeth, alterations in speech, and impairment of function. Hence, decayed primary teeth should not be extracted and treated whenever possible. Pulpectomy is generally recommended as a treatment of choice in such cases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic success of pulpectomized primary teeth with chronic infection using a mixture of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline (3MIX)-MP as an intracanal medicament before the obturation.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st2"><title><offsets xml_i="4638" xml_f="4650" txt_i="757" txt_f="769">Methodology:</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4661" xml_f="5017" txt_i="770" txt_f="1126">Sixty primary teeth were selected, which were randomly divided into two groups (Group A and Group B) with thirty teeth in each group.
