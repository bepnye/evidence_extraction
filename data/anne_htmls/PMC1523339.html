In the modules the counsellors discuss with the women allocated to the intervention group, how to control their weight during and after pregnancy, and how to maintain or optimize a healthy lifestyle in a period of drastic physical and mental changes. Women go through these counselling sessions in 30 weeks; they have appointments with their counsellor at 18, 22, 30 and 36 weeks of pregnancy and at 8 weeks postpartum. The counsellors, in charge of these counselling sessions, are members of the research team (see Counsellors). They are permanently linked to a specific midwifery practice. In this way, all women in the intervention group are assigned to a personal counsellor, facilitating the contact between participant and counsellor. Each counselling session takes 15 minutes, but the first session takes approximately half an hour, to explain the aim of the study and the intervention. The content of the first module is generalised and summarised in an information brochure, which the participants receive after the first counselling session of the intervention program.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20662" xml_f="20699" txt_i="15404" txt_f="15441">Rationale of the intervention program</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20710" xml_f="21325" txt_i="15442" txt_f="16057">During the New Life(style) program pregnant women in the intervention group receive individually tailored advice.
