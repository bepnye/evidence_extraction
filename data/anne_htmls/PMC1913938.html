Response rates of 59% and 55% were obtained for the telephone and mail nonresponse follow-up surveys, respectively.  A total of 197 respondents (51.8%) gave reasons related to technical issues or email as a means of communication, with older people more likely to give technical reasons for noncompletion; 144 (37.9%) gave reasons related to the intervention or the survey itself. Mail follow-up was substantially cheaper: We estimate that the telephone survey cost about US $34 per sampled case, compared to US $15 for the mail survey. The telephone responses were subject to possible social desirability effects, with the telephone respondents reporting significantly greater weight loss than the mail respondents.

Given that those who did not do any of the follow-up surveys comprised the largest group, we drew a systematic sample of cases from this group, but selected all those who did one or two of the follow-up surveys but not all three.

For these reasons we were interested in the efficacy of a mail follow-up relative to a telephone follow-up.

Switching from one self-administered mode (Web) to another (mail) is a largely untested approach. But if it works, it has potential cost benefits as well as the advantage of greater comparability of measurement. For this reason, we embedded a mode experiment in the nonresponse follow-up study, with 300 of the nonrespondents being randomly assigned to telephone and 400, to mail.

To produce crude estimates, we took the total cost of each operation and divided by the sample size and the number of completes, respectively. Costs for the telephone included the development of the short computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) instrument and conduct of the survey. Costs for the mail survey included the cost of printing the questionnaires and assembling the mailing packets, the cost of incentives and postage, and the cost of keying the data from the returned questionnaires.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28613" xml_f="29088" txt_i="17687" txt_f="18162">Based on these rough numbers, we estimate that the telephone survey cost about US $34 per sampled case, compared to US $15 for the mail survey. On the basis of completed questionnaires, the relative costs were approximately US $57 per completed case for the telephone survey and US $28 for the mail survey. Given this cost differential, the mail survey was not only almost as effective in terms of response rate as the telephone survey, but also substantially less expensive.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="29110" xml_f="29133" txt_i="18164" txt_f="18187">Reasons for Nonresponse</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29144" xml_f="29396" txt_i="18188" txt_f="18440">We included a few questions in the nonresponse follow-up survey to ascertain reasons for earlier nonresponse.

To examine this, we ran a logistic regression model predicting whether a case was a mail or telephone respondent, conditional on having completed the follow-up survey. None of the demographic or design variables we examined—age, gender, race, education, KP region, or treatment group—was statistically significant.

In his review of the attrition problem, Eysenbach [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2"><offsets xml_i="58656" xml_f="58657" txt_i="39385" txt_f="39386">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="58664" xml_f="59522" txt_i="39386" txt_f="40244">] argues that an intent-to-treat analysis, in which all dropouts are assumed to have negative or neutral outcomes, is the only way to avoid selection bias. We argue rather that weighting or imputation based on informed models of attrition or dropout requires fewer assumptions about the missing cases. As Hollis and Campbell [33, p. 673-674] note, “…no imputation method can give an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect unless the assumptions made about the missing data are valid.” A nonresponse follow-up study allows one not only to reduce the amount of missing data, but also to evaluate the missing data assumptions. To quote Hollis and Campbell [33, p. 674] again, “To fully appreciate the potential influence of missing responses, some form of sensitivity analysis is recommended, examining the effect of different strategies on the conclusions.”</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="59529" xml_f="59558" txt_i="40245" txt_f="40274">In work described elsewhere [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34"><offsets xml_i="59592" xml_f="59594" txt_i="40274" txt_f="40276">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="59601" xml_f="59726" txt_i="40276" txt_f="40401">], we used the data from the nonresponse follow-up to multiply-impute data for the remaining 12-month online nonrespondents [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35"><offsets xml_i="59760" xml_f="59762" txt_i="40401" txt_f="40403">35</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="59769" xml_f="60741" txt_i="40403" txt_f="41375">]. This method utilizes all available data, while accounting for the uncertainty due to imputation. Using a complete case analysis from the 12-month online respondents only, we would reach a conclusion that the treatment had a statistically significant effect on weight loss at 12 months relative to the control. However, using the data from the nonresponse follow-up to impute the missing 12-month cases, we would conclude that the differences between treatment and control, although still in the expected direction, do not reach statistical significance. These models are limited by the small number of cases included in the nonresponse follow-up relative to the number of nonrespondent cases and by the differences we found between the two modes of follow-up. Therefore, these results can only be viewed as suggestive. However, they allow us to explore the sensitivity of the substantive models to different assumptions about the missing data at the 12-month follow-up.</offsets></p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title><offsets xml_i="60797" xml_f="60807" txt_i="41379" txt_f="41389">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="60818" xml_f="61544" txt_i="41390" txt_f="42116">Our study has several potential limitations. First, the nonresponse follow-up was conducted within the context of a weight management intervention, which was restricted to overweight and obese members of a health maintenance organization (HMO) with regular Internet access. This may limit generalizability to other populations and settings. Second, this study did not test different ways to enhance the response rate to the 12-month online survey (eg, by using incentives). The success of the follow-up effort may be conditional on the initial response obtained. Third, this was a small-scale exploratory study embedded in a larger study. The small sample size may limit our ability to draw statistically reliable conclusions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="61551" xml_f="62008" txt_i="42117" txt_f="42574">Nonetheless, we have learned a number of things from this exploratory study. First, a significant proportion of those who drop out of an online RCT or intervention can be brought back by switching modes of data collection. A variety of technical reasons, unrelated to the online intervention, can account for a substantial proportion of such dropout, and modes switches are an effective counter to the uncertainties of using email as a communication medium.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="62015" xml_f="62843" txt_i="42575" txt_f="43403">Second, we learned that mail is almost as effective as the telephone for such follow-up. Further, it is significantly cheaper, and it is more similar to the original online mode in terms of visual design and response styles and shares the absence of social desirability effects associated with interviewers. For these reasons, we believe that the mail survey produced responses that are more comparable to the online responses than did the telephone survey. Telephone calls can be a useful tool for prompting or reminding respondents to return their questionnaires, but we believe that mail is a cost-effective method of following up online nonrespondents, if time is not a critical factor. On the basis of this work, we implemented a mail-only nonresponse follow-up study in a second controlled trial of a weight loss program [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30"><offsets xml_i="62877" xml_f="62879" txt_i="43403" txt_f="43405">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="62886" xml_f="62888" txt_i="43405" txt_f="43407">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="62895" xml_f="63456" txt_i="43408" txt_f="43969">Third, nonresponse follow-up studies such as this not only increase the number of cases for analysis but also help us understand the differences between those who drop out and those who complete all follow-up surveys. In other words, our analyses of treatment effects are not forced to rely on the often-heroic assumptions required by complete-case analysis. Nonresponse, or attrition, bias can be reduced in two ways: one is to reduce the rate of attrition, and the other is to reduce or measure the differences between those who drop out and those who don’t [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36"><offsets xml_i="63490" xml_f="63492" txt_i="43969" txt_f="43971">36</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="63499" xml_f="63837" txt_i="43971" txt_f="44309">]. We believe that following up nonrespondents—whether a sample of them as we did here, or all nonrespondents—using a different mode is a cost-effective way of increasing the analytic power and reducing the potential bias that may result from the relatively high rates of dropout experienced in online interventions and follow-up surveys.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Support for the evaluation of the tailored weight management study (THeME) came from Kaiser Permanente, and the study was implemented by Health Media, Inc.
