A total of 108 patients scheduled for thyroid surgery were randomly (envelope randomization) allocated to three groups: the control group (group C, n = 36), the ramosetron group (group R, n = 36), or the ramosetron plus dexamethasone group (group RD, n = 36). Each patient received 2 syringes immediately after the induction of anesthesia. Anesthetic nurses who were not involved in the study prepared these syringes. Patients in Group C received 1 and 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl intravenously (i.v.), those in Group R received 2 ml of 0.15 mg/ml ramosetron plus 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl, those in Group RD received 2 ml of 0.15 mg/ml ramosetron plus 1 ml of 5 mg/ml dexamethasone. All patients, investigators collecting the postoperative data, and nurses involved in the postoperative care of patients were blinded to the randomization. All patients were premedicated with midazolam 2-3 mg before arriving to the operating room. Heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram, and end-tidal carbon dioxide were recorded during surgery. Tympanic temperature was measured using a Thermoscan® (infrared tympanic thermometer IRT4020, Braun, Germany) immediately before induction of anesthesia, and just before extubation. Anesthesia was induced with a slow (30-60 s) i.v. bolus dose of remifentanil 1 µg/kg, followed by propofol 1-2 mg/kg in all groups, desflurane at an initial end-tidal concentration of 1 minimum alveolar concentration in 50% oxygen/air. The desflurane concentration was titrated in response to hemodynamic changes. Desflurane and remifentanil administration were stopped at the end of the procedure. Antagonism of muscle relaxation was achieved with pyridostigmine 0.2 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.008 mg/kg i.v., and when spontaneous ventilation of the patient was adequate, the endotracheal tube was subsequently extubated. After the operation, the patients were transferred to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), post- operatively. Primary outcome measures included the incidence of nausea, vomiting, and rescue antiemetic drug use within 48 h postoperatively. Nausea was defined as a subjectively unpleasant sensation associated with an awareness of the urge to vomit; vomiting was defined as the forceful expulsion of gastric contents through the mouth. Except for the expulsion of gastric contents, retching is similar to vomiting in all aspects. Therefore, it was considered as vomiting. The severity of nausea was assessed by a verbal rating scale (VRS) with choices ranging from 0 (none) to 100 (most severe). When moderate or severe nausea (VRS score &gt; 40) or vomiting was present, patients were asked if they required rescue antiemetics, and metoclopramide 10 mg was i.v. administered. Patients were specifically advised to call the nurse as soon as they felt any symptoms, not only of PONV, but also of any side effects, such as headache, dizziness, and drowsiness. Secondary outcome measures were the incidence of PAS, severity of postoperative pain VRS (0-100) during 1 h in PACU after surgery, and the total amount of rescue analgesic administered for 48 h post-operatively.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="12346" xml_f="12611" txt_i="7252" txt_f="7517">Shivering was defined as readily detectable fasciculation or tremors of the face, trunk, or limbs of a minimum of 10 seconds duration.
