Sessions at street level were conducted by Research Medical Officers (RMO) or trained female Community Health Workers (CHW), as appropriate, and focused on the importance of immunization against typhoid fever and other control measures. More intense promotion of the campaign began in June 2003, 4 weeks prior to the campaign, by a team of RMOs and social scientists, who conducted meetings with community and religious leaders, members of local government bodies, and street representatives. Information leaflets were distributed and announcements were made at local mosques. Suitable areas for vaccination posts in each cluster were identified. The day before the vaccination date, households were visited and given formal invitation letters that included the site, date, and time for vaccination.

External observers (2) monitored and documented key aspects (consent process, standards, safety, and cold chain) on designated forms. Seven community members assisted the campaign.

Vaccines were stored in several sites: the central warehouse, the AKU warehouse, a field site logistics center, and cool boxes at vaccination posts. At the logistics center an officer distributed the vaccine on a daily basis to each vaccination team. Temperature was monitored and documented as follows: constantly at the central warehouse, once a day at the AKU warehouse, twice or more each day at the logistics center, and in the field (by the team leader) at least twice a day. Alternate power supply was available at all storage locales. Cooling equipment at each storage site consisted of cold rooms, a chest refrigerator at the logistics center, and cool boxes with frozen ice packs for the vaccination teams.

Each vaccination team was in charge of one cluster and was assigned to deliver one and only one vaccine code letter (C, M). The chance of breaking the code was reduced by explaining the purpose of blinding to the teams, rechecking by another person at the time of distribution and follow up visits by site supervisors to ensure the same code is being given in the cluster that is assigned after randomization.

In 2004 in a separate vaccination campaign we were able to vaccinate 14406 children of the similar age group from the remaining 60 clusters. In this way the targeted sample size was achieved.

This, in turn, brought about unprecedented community rapport and response.
