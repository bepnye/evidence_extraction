Moreover, HTN is a key risk factor for health disease and stroke. African Americans disproportionately shoulder the burdens of HTN, with greater prevalence, disease severity, earlier onset, and more HTN-related complications than age-matched whites. Medication adherence for the treatment of HTN is poor, with estimates indicating that only about half of hypertensive patients are adherent to prescribed medication regimens. Although no single intervention for improving medication adherence has emerged as superior to others, text message medication reminders have the potential to help improve medication adherence in African Americans with uncontrolled HTN as mobile phone adoption is very high in this population.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title><offsets xml_i="6915" xml_f="6924" txt_i="900" txt_f="909">Objective</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6935" xml_f="7217" txt_i="910" txt_f="1192">The purpose of this two-phased study was to develop (Phase I) and test in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Phase II) a text message system, BPMED, to improve the quality of medication management through increasing medication adherence in African Americans with uncontrolled HTN.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="7258" xml_f="7265" txt_i="1194" txt_f="1201">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7276" xml_f="8010" txt_i="1202" txt_f="1936">In Phase I, we recruited 16 target end-users from a primary care clinic, to assist in the development of BPMED through participating in one of three focus groups.

In the second part, focus group members discussed HTN, medication regimens, medication adherence, and reasons for medication non-adherence. Finally, focus group participants were asked about mobile phones and text message use, and feedback was solicited regarding participant perceptions of using text messages for three different potential intervention functions: (1) to enable participant self-reporting of medication adherence, (2) to provide medication reminders, and (3) to receive educational information pertaining to HTN. In addition, participants were asked to identify what additional features would be useful in a text messaging program to increase medication adherence, as well as to identify potential problems that may be encountered by using text messaging for this purpose. The focus group protocol included prompts to solicit participant feedback on messaging frequency and content. Each of the three focus groups lasted approximately 90 minutes. At the conclusion of the focus groups, participants were given a US $25 cash incentive. In total, 16 individuals participated in one of three focus groups (n=6, n=4, and n=6, respectively).

In terms of mobile phone use, 100.0% (16/16) of focus group participants reported that they carried their mobile phone all day, every day, and had the ability to send and receive text messages. Regarding mobile phone plans, 66.7% (10/15) of participants reported that they had their mobile phone plans for 1 year or more, and 62.5% (10/16) report that unlimited text messaging was included in their mobile phone plan. Only 6.3% (1/16) report that they had used a prepaid mobile phone. Although text messaging capabilities were pervasive, only 56.3% (9/16) reported that they used text messaging daily.

Based on MMAS scores, the majority of our sample were considered to have low medication adherence (62.5%, 10/16), while 18.8% (3/16) were medium and 18.8% (3/16) were high adherers.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22808" xml_f="22828" txt_i="15225" txt_f="15245">Focus Group Findings</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22839" xml_f="23258" txt_i="15246" txt_f="15665">Based on the themes that emerged from our three focus groups, it was clear that participants did not always take their medications as prescribed, with participants stating: “I have to think about it: did I take that medicine? I’m afraid I’ll take a double dose, so I say ‘well, forget it’ ” and “I try to take my medication every day…The dosing is really easy, but I might take it later, like two or three hours later”.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23265" xml_f="24067" txt_i="15666" txt_f="16468">Reasons for not taking medications as prescribed varied, but simply forgetting to take their meds was cited by the majority of focus group participants as the primary reason for medication non-adherence. In addition, participants also mentioned issues related to fears of doubling up, stopping medications when HTN symptoms subsided, and undesirable side effects as reasons for non-adherence. Participants reported developing their own tricks for remembering to take medications, such as “Every time Steve Harvey [is on], I know it’s time to take my blood pressure medicine”. Participants overwhelmingly supported the use of text messaging, citing beliefs such as: “That’s the way people talk now” and “In this day and age, everybody texts…[You are going to] automatically look, just to see who it is”.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24074" xml_f="25026" txt_i="16469" txt_f="17421">In addition, the vast majority of participants thought that text message reminders would be helpful in improving medication adherence. Specifically, participants requested the ability to customize the frequency and timing of medication reminders each day. In addition, focus group participants indicated a preference for receiving educational text messages with information on topics such as nutrition and HTN symptoms, although a few expressed concerns about costs associated with receiving additional text messages. Although there was great support for receiving text message reminders for medication adherence, participants were adamant that they did not want to use text messaging for self-monitoring their adherence back to the study team. As our initial conceptualization of our intervention was based on the Theory of Self-Regulation and relied heavily on participant self-monitoring, this was key information to inform the development of BPMED.</offsets></p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="25078" xml_f="25085" txt_i="17422" txt_f="17429">Table 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="25105" xml_f="25176" txt_i="17429" txt_f="17500">Focus group participant characteristics (n=16, except where indicated).</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="671" border="0" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0"><col width="5" span="1"></col><col width="532" span="1"></col><col width="93" span="1"></col><thead><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><offsets xml_i="25427" xml_f="25441" txt_i="17501" txt_f="17515">Characteristic</offsets></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="25474" xml_f="25479" txt_i="17516" txt_f="17521">n (%)</offsets></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><offsets xml_i="25549" xml_f="25563" txt_i="17522" txt_f="17536">Age, mean (SD)</offsets></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="25596" xml_f="25606" txt_i="17537" txt_f="17547">50.8 (9.6)</offsets></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td colspan="3" rowspan="1"><offsets xml_i="25661" xml_f="25662" txt_i="17548" txt_f="17549">

Because we did not have access to all participant therapeutic regimens as documented in their medical records, we had to rely on participant self-reports of dosing regimens. Moreover, as dosing times vary between participants, sending daily reminders at times that participants were not taking their medications was considered not useful. As such, we allowed participants to set the number of text message reminders they wished to receive each day, as well as timing of the messages, to suit their needs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33976" xml_f="34741" txt_i="19705" txt_f="20470">In addition to medication reminders, eight educational messages (two/week) were developed and added to the intervention. These educational messages were based on HTN management recommendations from the American Heart Association and were focused on topics of smoking cessation, the importance of limiting dietary sodium, coping with stress, nutrition, weight reduction, limiting alcohol use, and physical activity. A weekly satisfaction question asking participants to rate their satisfaction with the BPMED intervention was also added. Finally, there were several study-related text messages that were used to enroll participants into BPMED, set up medication reminders, and remind participants to schedule their 1-month follow-up data collection appointment (see </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2"><offsets xml_i="34777" xml_f="34784" txt_i="20470" txt_f="20477">Table 2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34791" xml_f="35057" txt_i="20477" txt_f="20743"> for a complete listing of all text messages included in BPMED).

First, study staff enrolled each participant in an online participant management system with their name, phone number, and participant identification. As a part of this enrollment process, participants were required to read a statement that further clarified expectations for involvement in the study, as well as the number of text messages participants could expect to send/receive as a part of their participation. Directions for how to opt-out of the text message intervention were also provided. Once participants read the statement and checked a box indicating that they agreed, participants received an automated text message asking to confirm the participants’ desire to enroll in the text message intervention. After agreeing a second time to use the text message intervention, participants were fully enrolled and were instructed on how to set medication reminders.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36145" xml_f="36792" txt_i="21778" txt_f="22425">Although we had initially intended to ground our work with text messaging in a Theory of Self-Regulation framework, as previously mentioned, formative research revealed that target users were adamantly opposed to using text messaging to self-monitor their medication adherence. With our shift toward providing simple text message medication reminders, BPMED became more closely aligned with a Health Belief Model framework with medication reminders serving as cues to action, and educational messaging serving to increase participant perceived benefits of behavior change and self-efficacy, as well as reduce perceived barriers to behavior change.</offsets></p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="36844" xml_f="36851" txt_i="22426" txt_f="22433">Table 2</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="36871" xml_f="36911" txt_i="22433" txt_f="22473">Text messages included in BPMED by type.</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="800" border="0" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0"><col width="100" span="1"></col><col width="400" span="1"></col><col width="120" span="1"></col><thead><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="37165" xml_f="37180" txt_i="22474" txt_f="22489">Type of message</offsets></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="37213" xml_f="37231" txt_i="22490" txt_f="22508">Content of message</offsets></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="37264" xml_f="37305" txt_i="22509" txt_f="22550">Day of intervention that message was sent</offsets></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="37375" xml_f="37394" txt_i="22551" txt_f="22570">Medication reminder</offsets></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><offsets xml_i="37427" xml_f="37537" txt_i="22571" txt_f="22681">BPMED: Hello [first name], this is your [reminder time] reminder to take your medication.

We also acknowledge a lack of health care provider feedback in the design of BPMED and that many members of the care team, including physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, may have valuable insight to provide in the development of this sort of intervention. Given that this is a consumer-facing intervention that could be used independent of an established patient-provider relationship, we made the conscious decision to focus exclusively on the patient perspective in our design, but we do understand that additional provider feedback from a variety of care team members may have improved our ultimate design.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51989" xml_f="52337" txt_i="34821" txt_f="35169">Finally, the lack of additional rigorous objective measures of medication adherence, such as the use of electronic pill bottles or other objective devices, may weaken our primary outcome measure.
