The aim of the trial is to evaluate the treatment of depressive disorder in general hospitals in the Netherlands based on a collaborative care framework, including contracting, 'Problem Solving Treatment', antidepressant algorithm, and manual-guided self-help. 126 outpatients with diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cardiovascular diseases will be randomised to either the intervention group or the control group. Patients will be included if they have been diagnosed with moderate to severe depression, based on the DSM-IV criteria in a two-step screening method. The intervention group will receive treatment based on the collaborative care approach; the control group will receive 'care as usual'. Baseline and follow-up measurements (after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) will be performed by means of questionnaires. The primary outcome measure is severity of depressive symptoms, as measured with the PHQ-9.

MDD is not merely a secondary side-effect of a physical illness, but must be considered as a serious comorbid mental illness. The presence of depression has a negative effect on quality of life and increases morbidity, mortality and health care costs. However, early diagnosis and well-organized treatment of depression can have a positive influence on the costs, course, and side-effects of depression. In physically ill patients, the care has to be organized in such a way that the link with the general health care treatment can be good. Previous studies have shown that DMPs can be implemented successfully in the treatment of several – especially chronic – diseases; however, comorbid mental illnesses are not addressed in current DMP programs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16841" xml_f="17115" txt_i="10700" txt_f="10974">The present study will focus on patients suffering from three prevalent chronic physical diseases, namely DM, COPD, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

Treatment for depression will therefore be integrated in a collaborative care intervention package incorporating the principles of DMPs for the treatment of comorbid DM, CVD, and COPD. Outpatients of a general hospital who visit the DM, CVD, or COPD clinics and who have a comorbid depressive disorder will participate in this study. The collaborative care intervention package will include contracting, PST, an antidepressant algorithm, and manual-guided self-help, according to the basic model of patient and provider adherence-enhancing techniques. The interventions will be tailored to patient preferences, and compared with well-documented CAU. All treatments included in this study have individually been proven effective. The progress of the patient will be monitored and, if necessary, the treatment will be adapted. DMPs have already been proven to be effective and cost-effective as well.
