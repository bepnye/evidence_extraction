Secondly, as a single-centre observational study, the generalizability of our results could be questioned. However the lenient inclusion and exclusion criteria does increase generalizability of the results. The cross-sectional nature of the data for baseline BP measurement, lack of ambulatory blood pressure measurements and assessment of LV hypertrophy without an assessment of volume status prevents us from drawing firm conclusions, however, the results are further supported by cumulative BP measurements obtained over a 12 month period. Finally, our study included patients with a wide range of ESRD etiologies, including diabetes and heart failure, both of which contribute to LV hypertrophy. The autonomic and cardiovascular dysfunction in these disease processes could have confounded the BP-LV hypertrophy correlation. Further studies are necessary to delineate whether these co-morbidities affect the BP-LV hypertrophy relationship.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38225" xml_f="38235" txt_i="21367" txt_f="21377">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38246" xml_f="39053" txt_i="21378" txt_f="22185">In summary, we found that a single standardized BP measurement has strong predictive power for LV hypertrophy, but is not significantly better than casual post- and intra-dialysis BP measurements taken at a single point in time or over several months. For ease of practice, a single standardized measurement performs just as well as the more resource intensive cumulative measurements. Given the poor agreement with other methods, and relatively poor predictive power of a single pre-dialysis measurement in predicting LV hypertrophy, the results of this study also suggest that the current practice guidelines, which advocate the use of pre-dialysis measurements for chronic hemodialysis patients, warrants further study. This study does not however provide strong evidence to disregard current guidelines.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39075" xml_f="39088" txt_i="22187" txt_f="22200">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39099" xml_f="39483" txt_i="22201" txt_f="22585">HD: hemodialysis; LV: left ventricular; ESRD: end stage renal disease; BP: blood pressure; cMR: cardiac MRI; PTH: parathyroid hormone; SD: standard deviation; IQR: inter-quartile range; CCC: concordance correlation coefficient; ROC: receiver operated characteristic; AUC: area under the curve; CI: confidence intervals; SBP: systolic blood pressure; ACE: angiotensin converting enzyme</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39505" xml_f="39524" txt_i="22587" txt_f="22606">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39535" xml_f="39593" txt_i="22607" txt_f="22665">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39615" xml_f="39637" txt_i="22667" txt_f="22689">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39648" xml_f="40068" txt_i="22690" txt_f="23110">BRH, MT, SWK, BJM, and BFC made substantial contributions to conception, design and acquisition of data and funds.
