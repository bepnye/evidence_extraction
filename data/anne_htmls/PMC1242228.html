Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan.

The main study main study holds unique elements. The intervention concerns pro-active care that should guarantee timely detection of patients with frailer health, followed by structured nurse-led care focusing on patients. It focuses on the client as well as on the system around the client. The nurses use the Resident Assessment Instrument; a comprehensive geriatric assessment protocol that, by computerization, triggers health risks and, hereby, guides care planning.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37640" xml_f="38230" txt_i="24032" txt_f="24622">The main study achieved a substantial response on the postal COOP-WONCA screening. In our pilot study, home visits by nurses were regarded to have potential for quality of care improvement. Point of concern was the inadequate selection of frail patients by the PCPs. Also, the assessment protocol used by the nurses provided no triggers on when actions should follow. In a second pilot study, the COOP-WONCA emerged as the most feasible postal screener compared to vulnerable elders survey (VES-13) and the Frailty screening list of Strawbridge. Our selection rule identified a frail group.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38237" xml_f="39424" txt_i="24623" txt_f="25810">Limitations to the generalizability of our future findings are firstly the non-response to the mailed health survey. A number of persons (n = 100) responded but did not want to participate because of their good health. We remain uncertain about other non-responders being frailer and perhaps in greater need of nurse support. In future projects alternative means for health screening may be tested in older PCP patients such as contacting consulting patients. Secondly, our RAI assessment demanded a structured approach of computer skilled persons. The computer skills of the nurses were rather limited which led to extensive additional training. Some nurses had difficulties with the computerized assessments and disliked the structured format in which the assessment took place. Thirdly, we remain uncertain about the best frailty measure to identify persons that can benefit most from preventive actions. We selected the COOP-WONCA because of its broad health definition and very good feasibility. Last, whether PCPs remain blind for group assignment during he follow up remains to be seen. It is possible that the regular contacts with the nurses will reveal some of the assignments.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39446" xml_f="39465" txt_i="25812" txt_f="25831">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39476" xml_f="39536" txt_i="25832" txt_f="25892">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39558" xml_f="39580" txt_i="25894" txt_f="25916">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39591" xml_f="39706" txt_i="25917" txt_f="26032">HPJvH, GN and HWJvM designed the study.
