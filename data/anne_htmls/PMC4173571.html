Anesthetists who were blinded to group allocation recorded each episode of nausea, retching and vomiting. All patients were monitored for PONV for 48 h post-operatively after extubation. An episode of PONV was defined as nausea (subjective feeling of the need to vomit), vomiting (expulsion of stomach contents) or retching (an involuntary attempt to vomit but not productive of stomach contents). All episodes of nausea which were immediately followed by retching or vomiting were taken as an episode of retching or vomiting respectively. In case, the patient exhibited all the three symptoms within 1-2 min, it was taken as one episode of vomiting for statistical purposes. Patients who had only nausea (for more than 10 min) without retching or vomiting were taken as an episode of nausea. To calculate incidence of PONV and avoid duplication of results, a patient exhibiting a combination or all the symptoms was taken as one. Injection metoclopramide 10 mg IV was used as the rescue antiemetic (RAE) in the event of patient having nausea lasting more than 10 min duration or an episode of retching or vomiting. All patients were monitored for sedation and it was scored using the following sedation score Grade I - alert/oriented, Grade II - sedated but responsive to verbal commands and Grade III - sedated but responsive to physical stimulation. Degree of analgesia was noted by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and rescue analgesic diclofenac sodium 1 mg/kg IM was given 8 hourly and also when score was more than 3.

The intra operative use of nitrous oxide, isoflurane and dexamethasone could have influenced the baseline PONV incidence in our study. Future studies investigating administration of 5HT3 antagonist both at the start and end of surgery and combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods could be the strategies to further reduce PONV in these patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title><offsets xml_i="25502" xml_f="25512" txt_i="17614" txt_f="17624">CONCLUSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="25523" xml_f="26085" txt_i="17625" txt_f="18187">Combination regimen of granisetron or ondansetron in doses of 1 and 4 mg with dexamethasone respectively provide superior and effective antiemetic prophylaxis compared with Dexamethasone alone in adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy without producing any significant side-effects or affecting neurocognitive monitoring which is so essential in post-operative neurosurgical care. We recommend the prophylactic antiemetic combination of granisetron or ondansetron in doses of 1 and 4 mg respectively with dexamethasone for preventing post craniotomy PONV.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kathirvel</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Dash</surname><given-names>HH</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhatia</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Subramaniam</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Prakash</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Shenoy</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of prophylactic ondansetron on postoperative nausea and vomiting after elective craniotomy</article-title><source>J Neurosurg Anesthesiol</source><year>2001</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>207</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11426094</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Neufeld</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Newburn-Cook</surname><given-names>CV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The efficacy of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting after craniotomy: A meta-analysis</article-title><source>J Neurosurg Anesthesiol</source><year>2007</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>10</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17198095</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>Tripathi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ambesh</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy of ondansetron in prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting in patients following infratentorial surgery: A placebo-controlled prospective double-blind study</article-title><source>J Neurosurg Anesthesiol</source><year>1999</year><volume>11</volume><fpage>6</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9890379</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Islam</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>PN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Post-operative nausea and vomiting: A review article</article-title><source>Indian J Anaesth</source><year>2004</year><volume>48</volume><fpage>253</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fabling</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Guy</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Borel</surname><given-names>CO</given-names></name><name><surname>el-Moalem</surname><given-names>HE</given-names></name><name><surname>Warner</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postoperative nausea and vomiting.
