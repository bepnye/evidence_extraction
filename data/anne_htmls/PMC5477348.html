A similar prevalence has been reported for gestational diabetes (GDM) and although it is not yet high on the national agenda, immediate and long-term complications threaten the health of mothers and future generations. A situational analysis on GDM conducted in 2015 revealed difficulties in access to screening and delays in receiving appropriate care.

In each district, 10 health centers were randomly selected with half of them serving as intervention and half as control facilities.

In the control facilities, screening and initial management of GDM will apply standard practice. Birthweight of newborns of women with GDM will be compared between both groups and the prevalence of GDM at health center level assessed.

The detection and initial management of GDM during ANC through the first level of care could be an appropriate approach to establish timely interventions.

Although general practitioners at health centers manage diabetic patients, the treatment of gestational diabetes is often reserved for specialists implying difficulties in access to higher levels of care and treatment delays. Implementation of a strategy that enables the primary health care sector to detect, initiate treatment and follow-up affected women has the potential to improve access to care, timely management and reduce obstetric and neonatal complications. The implication of the Moroccan Ministry of Health in the design and conduct of the study will be pivotal for the decision of a future scaling up. Although such a decision will be guided by acceptance, feasibility and clinical outcomes, the financial consequences cannot be omitted. Therefore an economic evaluation of the intervention is envisaged.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANC</term><def><p>Antenatal Care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GA</term><def><p>Gestational Age</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GDM</term><def><p>Gestational Diabetes Mellitus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OGTT</term><def><p>Oral Glucose Tolerance Test</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Health in particular Laila Acharai and her team at the Division for the Protection of Maternal and Newborn Health for their dedication in the development of the nutritional guidelines that pathed the way for the implementation of this protocol.
