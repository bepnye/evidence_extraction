However, the withdrawal of one of these PCTs necessitated the recruitment of a replacement PCT served by a second register. Several factors led to the withdrawal of this PCT. Despite our having appropriate administrative approval, when the trial began it became apparent that the administrative authority did not have the cooperation necessary for all of the GPs to participate in the trial. Consequently we had to enrol individual practices directly (rather than via the PCT), which resulted in fewer practices enrolling and our being at risk of not achieving our required sample size. We recruited a further PCT to address this problem, however, the original PCT then suspended involvement with the diabetes register and their practices had to be excluded from the study.

In summary the pre-existing diabetes register functioned as a central register of patients with diabetes. A structured dataset was completed on paper forms and returned to the central register; the hospital laboratory provided a monthly download of laboratory test results (e.g. HbA1c) for patients on the register. From this data both patient-specific and aggregated data were provided annually to patients and clinicians. The pre-existing system was passive, in that it did not request data for patients, rather it summarised the data it received. We postulated that the platueauing of performance that had been documented was due to clinicians failing to deliver appropriate clinical interventions due to a lack of co-ordination (patients being lost to follow up) and either a lack of awareness of appropriate care, or forgetting to deliver all that was required when patients were seen.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21562" xml_f="22846" txt_i="15597" txt_f="16881">In the enhanced structured and recall management system, a 'circle of information exchange' was established between the participating general practices and the database. The central database system identified when patients were due for review and generated a letter to the patients asking them to make an appointment for a review consultation. The rules for generation of review letters were adapted for each PCT area. In one PCT, the system acted as a prompting system for annual review, and patients were identified 11 months after their last diabetes appointment. In the other two PCTs, patients who had missed annual reviews were identified by searching for patients who had not had a diabetes appointment for 14 months or more. At the same time, the central database generated a letter to the practice stating that the patient should be making a review appointment in the near future. The letter to the practice included a 'structured management sheet' (to be held in the patient's record) to capture an agreed minimum data set that would be collected during the consultation. This management sheet also contained relevant prompts tailored to a patient's known clinical or biochemical values, derived from locally adapted, national evidence-based guidelines [see Additional file </offsets><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1"><offsets xml_i="22895" xml_f="22896" txt_i="16881" txt_f="16882">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22903" xml_f="22905" txt_i="16882" txt_f="16884">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22912" xml_f="23533" txt_i="16885" txt_f="17506">When the patient was seen in the practice, the primary care professional (often the practice nurse) completed the management sheet and returned a copy for entry into the central register within a designated period of time. This circle of information was broken if the patient did not visit the general practice as planned or the general practice did not return the management sheet to the central register. If this happened, the central register would print reminder letters and further structured management sheets at the next routine database search by the diabetes register facilitator, which occurred at least weekly.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23540" xml_f="24005" txt_i="17507" txt_f="17972">In addition to this cycle based on annual reviews, routine ongoing structured management sheets were produced every time a patient in an intervention practice was identified by the diabetes register facilitator on the register database. For example, when data were inputted on the database for any reason, the system would print a structured management sheet updated for any new data and relevant management prompts, and this would be sent to the relevant practice.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24012" xml_f="24623" txt_i="17973" txt_f="18584">The trial intervention ran for 15 months, commencing on 1 April 2002 and ending on 30 June 2003. The letters to patients inviting them for annual review commenced in October 2002 – delayed to overcome concerns about the accuracy of patient details on the database up to this point. The enhanced system also was capable of producing patient letters to accompany routine ongoing structured management sheets for practices, but because of difficulties operating this element of the software it was not possible to run this feature during the lifetime of the trial. This was a deviation from the published protocol.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24645" xml_f="24651" txt_i="18586" txt_f="18592">Ethics</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="24662" xml_f="24794" txt_i="18593" txt_f="18725">The study was approved by the South Tyneside, Southwest Durham, Hartlepool, and North Tees Local Research Ethics Committees (LRECs).</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24822" xml_f="24829" txt_i="18728" txt_f="18735">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="24840" xml_f="24847" txt_i="18736" txt_f="18743">Figure </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="24877" xml_f="24878" txt_i="18743" txt_f="18744">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24885" xml_f="25695" txt_i="18744" txt_f="19554"> shows the number of practices and patients at each stage of the study.

and were not significantly different between intervention and control groups. The intervention costs were: UK£11,443 for developing the local guidelines, UK£14,034 for software development, and UK£2,408 for educational activities. This gave a total one-off cost of initiating the system across the two register areas of UK£27,885. The additional annual cost of running the system for the two registers was UK£11,170. Based on the interviews with practice-based informants, the mean maximum annual cost per patient that the practices had to meet when using the system (including staff time and consumables) was estimated at £76.46 per patient; the minimum annual costs were zero. However, because of the semi-structured nature of the interviews, it was not possible to accurately estimate the distribution of costs within this range.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T5"><label><offsets xml_i="47720" xml_f="47727" txt_i="29505" txt_f="29512">Table 5</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="47747" xml_f="47806" txt_i="29512" txt_f="29571">Economic analysis profile (Costs expressed in 2002/03 UK£).</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="47891" xml_f="47916" txt_i="29572" txt_f="29597">Type of service/resource </offsets></bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold><offsets xml_i="47965" xml_f="47986" txt_i="29598" txt_f="29619">Mean (SD) per patient</offsets></bold></td><td align="center" colspan="2"><bold><offsets xml_i="48035" xml_f="48101" txt_i="29620" txt_f="29686">Effect of intervention adjusted for a difference between registers</offsets></bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="48171" xml_f="48178" txt_i="29688" txt_f="29695">Control</offsets></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="48215" xml_f="48227" txt_i="29696" txt_f="29708">Intervention</offsets></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="48264" xml_f="48271" txt_i="29709" txt_f="29716">p-value</offsets></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="48308" xml_f="48321" txt_i="29717" txt_f="29730">Mean (95% CI)</offsets></bold></td></tr><tr><td colspan="5"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="48404" xml_f="48413" txt_i="29732" txt_f="29741">NHS Costs</offsets></bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="48487" xml_f="48530" txt_i="29746" txt_f="29789">Primary care visits/consultations (n = 965)</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="48554" xml_f="48568" txt_i="29790" txt_f="29804">135.61 (43.40)</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="48592" xml_f="48606" txt_i="29805" txt_f="29819">136.67 (40.40)</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="48630" xml_f="48634" txt_i="29820" txt_f="29824">0.96</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="48658" xml_f="48676" txt_i="29825" txt_f="29843">0.50 (-21.5;

In addition, four of the provider adherence variables (recording of HbA1c, cholesterol, serum creatinine, and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio) were not reliant on recording within general practices; they were routinely transferred into the diabetes databases directly from the laboratory information systems, and so would not be subject to any recording effect. Whilst these were not statistically significantly different between intervention and control groups, many clinicians would regard changes of this size as clinically significant (16% increase in HbA1c recording and 21% increase in cholesterol recording).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="55014" xml_f="56074" txt_i="33948" txt_f="35008">There is some suggestion of under-recording of data on the registers, with an apparently low proportion of people on aspirin and insulin (mirrored by an apparently high proportion of people on diet alone). This is almost certainly due to a combination of factors of which a degree of under-recording is only one. Low aspirin prescription rates could be due to patients buying aspirin directly from pharmacies rather than receiving it via prescription (common in the UK). This is supported by the figures for self-reported aspirin use being higher than those on the registers. Excluded from the study were people being treated for their diabetes solely by hospital, who are more likely to be treated on insulin and less likely to be on diet alone. However, while we have the same rates for patients treated with diet alone from the register and from self-report, self-report of insulin use was considerably higher than on the registers. This suggests that insulin use was under-recorded on the registers, but equally so for both intervention and control groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="56081" xml_f="56732" txt_i="35009" txt_f="35660">Unlike the studies in the review, we found no significant effect on levels of HbA1c. This may reflect the overall levels of control in our study population with baseline HbA1c of 7.7, and both groups improving to 7.3. The studies in the review were conducted in more poorly controlled populations, with median baseline HbA1c values of over 8 (and in one case over 10). Our findings also may reflect the relatively short period for which the intervention ran as fully intended. While the intervention was in place for the planned 15 months, the full intervention ran for only 9 months, and the intended patient intervention was never fully operational.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="56739" xml_f="57241" txt_i="35661" txt_f="36163">We did, however, show a modest and statistically significant lowering of serum cholesterol of 0.15 mmol/l in the intervention group compared to the control group. As the impact of the intervention on medication, including lipid-lowering therapy, was unclear from the register-derived data and negative from the patient-reported data, it is possible that this effect may be due to the increased delivery of dietary advice – one of the four areas of improvement in provider adherence to recommended care.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="57248" xml_f="57854" txt_i="36164" txt_f="36770">We showed no significant difference in patient-reported outcomes between intervention and control groups.

Whilst for any individual practice the figures would be proportionately lower, in a demand-led system such as UK general practice, coping with such innovations should be accompanied by commensurate resources. This is particularly important when, as in this case, an innovation can reside in specialist services or hospital care that has no responsibility for expenditure incurred in family or general practice.
