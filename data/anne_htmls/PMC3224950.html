Evidence suggests that this ability to self-assess is limited, and more so in the least competent. Therefore, it may be of benefit to utilise some form of external assessment for this purpose. Many diabetes educational programmes have been introduced, but few have been assessed for their benefit in a systematic manner. As diabetes is an increasingly prevalent disease, methods for the dissemination and understanding of clinical guidelines need to be explored for their effectiveness. This paper describes the study design of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of using an interactive online Diabetes Needs Assessment Tool (DNAT), that builds a learning curriculum based on identified knowledge gaps, compared with conventional self-directed learning. The study assesses the effect of these interventions on health professionals' knowledge of diabetes management, evaluates the acceptability of this process of learning and self-reported changes in clinical practice as a result of this novel educational process.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6013" xml_f="6020" txt_i="1215" txt_f="1222">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6031" xml_f="7164" txt_i="1223" txt_f="2356">Following a baseline assessment, participants will be randomised to undergo a 4-month learning period where they will either be given access to the diabetes learning modules alone (control group) or a Diabetes Needs Assessment Tool (DNAT) plus the diabetes learning modules (intervention group). On completion of the DNAT, a personalised learning report will be created for each participant identifying needs alongside individualised recommendations of the most appropriate learning modules to meet those requirements. All participants will complete a Diabetes Knowledge Test before and immediately after the allocated learning and the primary outcome will be the state of knowledge at 4 months. Learners will also be surveyed immediately after the learning period to assess the acceptability of the learning formats and the perceived usefulness and usability of the materials. After a further month, all learners will receive a series of questions to evaluate self-reported changes in clinical practice as a result of this educational experience and asked to include specific examples of any changes in their diabetes care practice.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7186" xml_f="7204" txt_i="2358" txt_f="2376">Trial registration</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7215" xml_f="7255" txt_i="2377" txt_f="2417">Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN67215088</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7317" xml_f="7327" txt_i="2426" txt_f="2436">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7338" xml_f="7751" txt_i="2437" txt_f="2850">Doctors need ongoing learning in order to stay up to date.

It is a computerised adaptive test comprised of clinically rich case problems developed by a group of diabetologists/educationalists. The 253 DNAT test items have already been validated through use with a large number of learners with a range of ability registered on BMJ OnExamination. The items cover six categories: Principles of Diabetes (53 items), Lifestyle (49 items), Drug Treatment (64 items), CVS/Macrovascular (34 items), Acute Complications (21 items), Microvascular Complications (32 items). The DNAT can be completed over several sessions if required and takes the learner approximately 90 to 120 minutes to complete. Not all learners will see the same questions as the test adapts to knowledge level as individuals complete it. On completion of the DNAT, a personalised learning report is created for each learner identifying learning needs alongside individualised recommendations of the most appropriate Diabetes Learning Modules to meet those needs. At any stage this personalised report can be viewed listing the performance of the learner at that point.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21556" xml_f="21572" txt_i="15329" txt_f="15345">Outcome measures</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21592" xml_f="21615" txt_i="15346" txt_f="15369">Primary Outcome measure</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21635" xml_f="21658" txt_i="15370" txt_f="15393">Diabetes Knowledge Test</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21669" xml_f="22336" txt_i="15394" txt_f="16061">The Diabetes Knowledge Test contains 20 multiple choice questions (in the format of single best answer out of five possible options).
