It has been shown to safely increase the milk supply of lactating women. To date, researchers have analyzed the effects of domperidone on lactating woman with respect to the quantity of their milk production, adverse effects, and drug levels in the breast milk. However, the effect of domperidone on the macronutrient composition of breast milk has not been studied and current guidelines for fortification of human milk for premature infants do not distinguish between those women using or those not using domperidone.

Nutritive benefits include a whey predominant protein source, which is more easily digested and promotes more rapid gastric emptying.

Fifty-five percent of these mothers had experienced lactation failure, several of whom had been prescribed domperidone (domperidone is not prescribed routinely in this centre). Therefore, 20–23 women a year will be eligible for the study. Recruitment rates for research studies in our NICU range from 60–100 percent.

Currently, guidelines for fortification of human milk for preterm infants do not distinguish between women using or not using domperidone. Domperidone causes an increase in maternal prolactin levels and has been shown to significantly increase human breast milk volumes. No study has examined the effect of domperidone use (to augment lactation) on the composition of breast milk. The purpose of this study is to compare the macronutrient and macro mineral composition of breast milk between mothers of infants delivered at less than 31 weeks gestation, receiving domperidone versus placebo. If significant differences in nutrient content occur between groups, alterations to current standards of feeding practices for premature infants may need to be made in order to optimize growth and nutrition. The results of this study will provide clinicians with valuable information to aid in guiding feeding practices for preterm infants.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="42444" xml_f="42511" txt_i="32974" txt_f="33041">Potential risks to the safety of participants involved in the study</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="42531" xml_f="42570" txt_i="33042" txt_f="33081">a.
