However, little is known about the lasting physical and mental health effects following a bite. We recently reported that mental problems, with harmful social outcomes, can occur in many people after they are bitten by a snake. As the affected are often poor farmers or manual workers, this may affect their livelihoods. We, therefore, performed a trial which looked at the effectiveness of short psychological interventions, lasting about 15 and 20 minutes, which can be provided by even non-specialist doctors, in reducing these mental and social problems in people bitten by snakes. Our results show that such interventions may indeed be helpful to reduce some of these problems, but more research is needed to improve these interventions, especially so that they that can reduce post-traumatic stress disorder and depression after snakebite.</offsets></p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was supported by the South Asian Clinical Toxicology Research Collaboration (SACTRC) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sactrc.org/">http://www.sactrc.org/</ext-link>).

The conversation was then moved into a more structured discussion, using a structured check list to ensure a degree of standardization. This list included important thoughts to elicit, such as myths, negative assumptions, and future plans and expectations of the patient. If any erroneous or maladaptive ideas were identified, they were challenged in a non-confrontational manner and more plausible, evidence based alternative views were expressed.

A checklist guided the doctors providing the intervention to identify the victims’ dysfunctional cognitions related to health, personal life, functional abilities, and overall future expectations. If dysfunctional cognitions were elicited, they were reframed in a positive manner. The doctors also encouraged return to work and normal life. In patients who had not gone back to work to an optimal level, activity scheduling was introduced. A phased return to household and occupational activity was suggested and patients were encouraged to return to their hobbies and pleasurable activities. Other maladaptive coping methods such as substance misuse were discussed and counseling provided as needed. In situations where there was a understandable anxiety about returning to work and being bitten again by a snake, practical safety measures such as wearing boots and gloves and carrying a torch and a stick were encouraged. The duration of this intervention was typically 20 minutes.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec016"><title><offsets xml_i="23592" xml_f="23636" txt_i="13591" txt_f="13635">Data Collection—Post-Intervention Assessment</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23647" xml_f="23991" txt_i="13636" txt_f="13980">Patients were assessed for presence of psychological morbidity and functional status six months following discharge from hospital by a specialist psychiatrist blind to intervention status and trained in the usage of the study tools.

The interventions did not reduce the proportion of patients with PTSD or overall depression, but appeared to reduce severe depression. The apparent discrepancy in the fact that overall depression was not reduced though there was a reduction in severe depression in the intervention groups, may reflect the fact that the interventions are simply effective in converting severe depression to milder forms. Our findings have important implications given the potential the socio-economic burden that may result from psychological disability following snakebite envenoming in this predominantly subsistence farming population.

Although of potential interest, we were unable to perform a subgroup analysis of our results based on biting species as the offending snake was identified in a minority of cases.
