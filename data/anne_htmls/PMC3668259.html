Since the individuals involved in data collection are not health workers, their skills do not extend to management of illness. If it appears to an interviewer that a respondent has a personal or family problem, she will have a duty of care to communicate this and support access to consultation, support which we will facilitate through orientation and provision of information on sources of help.

However, the nature of the work will be that women and children at risk will be identified, since this is the point. They may be malnourished, have concerns about family planning or institutional delivery, or be experiencing domestic violence. It is therefore crucial that resource center community workers - and the project as a whole - have clear protocols for addressing such concerns. SNEHA has been working in this domain for over a decade now, and ethical approval has required us to present detailed protocols for training, information and action across a range of concerns.
