Our study was underpowered to demonstrate an effect of rHuEPO on mortality or resource utilization (i.e. length of ICU or hospital stay, and ICU and ventilator free days). Nevertheless, Corwin and coworkers [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"><offsets xml_i="31167" xml_f="31169" txt_i="22460" txt_f="22462">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31176" xml_f="31650" txt_i="22462" txt_f="22936">] reported that neither morbidity nor mortality differed significantly between critically ill patients receiving rHuEPO 40,000 once per week and a placebo group. However, interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that the majority of patients receiving rHuEPO were anaemic by the end of the study, and Hb level differed slightly between groups (approximately 0.3 g/dl). Considering the relationship between the level of anaemia and morbidity and mortality [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"><offsets xml_i="31682" xml_f="31684" txt_i="22936" txt_f="22938">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31691" xml_f="31692" txt_i="22938" txt_f="22939">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26"><offsets xml_i="31724" xml_f="31726" txt_i="22939" txt_f="22941">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31733" xml_f="32131" txt_i="22941" txt_f="23339">], the inability of this rHuEPO regimen to increase Hb to normal levels might have influenced the morbidity and mortality data. Perhaps doses of rHuEPO that result in near normal values of Hb and Hct such as those used in the present study (i.e. 40,000 units three times per week) may be associated with improved outcome. Further studies with the appropriate power are needed to resolve this issue.</offsets></p><p></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="32160" xml_f="32170" txt_i="23342" txt_f="23352">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32181" xml_f="32588" txt_i="23353" txt_f="23760">In conclusion, the present study showed that administration of rHuEPO reduces the need for RBC transfusion in critically ill patients. The magnitude of this reduction was similar between the two dosing schedules. On the other hand, rHuEPO increased Hb and Hct in a dose dependent manner. These results indicate that dose of rHuEPO in critically ill patients should be titrated depending on the desired goal.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="32610" xml_f="32622" txt_i="23762" txt_f="23774">Key messages</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="32633" xml_f="32725" txt_i="23775" txt_f="23867">• 	Administration of rHuEPO reduced the need for RBC transfusion in critically ill patients.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32732" xml_f="32812" txt_i="23868" txt_f="23948">• 	The magnitude of this reduction was similar between the two dosing schedules.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32819" xml_f="32892" txt_i="23949" txt_f="24022">• 	rHuEPO administration increases Hb and Hct in a dose dependent manner.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32899" xml_f="32994" txt_i="24023" txt_f="24118">• 	The dose of rHuEPO in critically ill patients may be titrated depending on the desired goal.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33016" xml_f="33029" txt_i="24120" txt_f="24133">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33040" xml_f="33168" txt_i="24134" txt_f="24262">Hb = haemoglobin; Hct = haematocrit; ICU = intensive care unit; RBC = red blood cell; rHuEPO = recombinant human erythropoietin.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33190" xml_f="33209" txt_i="24264" txt_f="24283">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33220" xml_f="33280" txt_i="24284" txt_f="24344">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="33302" xml_f="33324" txt_i="24346" txt_f="24368">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="33335" xml_f="33485" txt_i="24369" txt_f="24519">DG designed the study, supervised the study, analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript.
