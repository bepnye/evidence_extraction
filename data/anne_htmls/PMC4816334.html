To this purpose, we carefully selected students with high levels of study-related fatigue and randomly assigned them to either an exercise intervention or wait list in order to establish to what extent the exercise intervention reduced fatigue (primary outcome) as compared to the natural course of time.

Additionally, emotional exhaustion, overall fatigue, and sleep quality had further improved 12 weeks after the intervention. These improvements were not affected by the amount of exercise participants engaged in during the follow up period. This might be due to lack of variance in time spent on exercising, as most exercisers chose to engage in exercise after the intervention period (80%) on a regular basis (113.93 minutes [</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="119713" xml_f="119715" txt_i="52649" txt_f="52651">SD</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="119724" xml_f="119742" txt_i="52651" txt_f="52669"> = 88.51] a week).</offsets></p><sec id="sec034"><title><offsets xml_i="119770" xml_f="119829" txt_i="52670" txt_f="52729">Strengths, limitations, and suggestions for future research</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="119840" xml_f="119982" txt_i="52730" txt_f="52872">We believe that a major strength of this study is its RCT-design, including longitudinal follow-up measures, and intention-to-treat analysis [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0152137.ref071" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="120030" xml_f="120032" txt_i="52872" txt_f="52874">71</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="120039" xml_f="120372" txt_i="52874" txt_f="53207">].

We found that low intensity running three times a week had beneficial effects on various outcomes. Although it remains unknown whether this dose/type of exercise delivers optimal effects on the study outcomes, we showed that this intervention is at least feasible and accessible for university students with high levels of study-related fatigue, as dropout remained very low (i.e., 8% drop out rate) and compliance was high (i.e., 81% of running sessions was attended). Furthermore, a large majority of the students (i.e., 80%) chose to still engage in regular exercise in the 12 weeks after the intervention. It thus seems that this intervention has the potential to stimulate regular exercise patterns in the longer term. Future studies are recommended in which different exercise doses or types can be compared for investigating optimal effects on our outcomes. We believe that the exercise intensity in such studies should not be too high, as this may not or even negatively impact outcomes such as fatigue [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0152137.ref074" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="121770" xml_f="121772" txt_i="54441" txt_f="54443">74</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="121779" xml_f="121805" txt_i="54443" txt_f="54469">], cognitive performance [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0152137.ref075" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="121853" xml_f="121855" txt_i="54469" txt_f="54471">75</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="121862" xml_f="121884" txt_i="54471" txt_f="54493">], and sleep quality [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0152137.ref027" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="121932" xml_f="121934" txt_i="54493" txt_f="54495">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="121941" xml_f="122009" txt_i="54495" txt_f="54563">], especially in participants who are already fatigued at the start.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="122016" xml_f="122914" txt_i="54564" txt_f="55462">Apart from these strengths, several theoretical and methodological issues deserve discussion. These relate to the choice of employing a non-blinded wait-list design. As a result of using a wait list as control condition, we cannot rule out that the positive study findings are (partly) due to other ingredients of the intervention than exercise itself (i.e., non-specific factors), such as social support that may be provided in the group running sessions. Another consequence of this design is that we could not make firm conclusions about follow-up effects, as it was not possible to compare exercisers and controls in that period (i.e., controls received the exercise intervention after six weeks of waiting). Despite the limitations associated with a wait list design, we believe the choice for such a design is justified, because it is suitable for a first evaluation of a novel intervention [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0152137.ref076" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="122962" xml_f="122964" txt_i="55462" txt_f="55464">76</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="122971" xml_f="123260" txt_i="55464" txt_f="55753">] and because a proven effective standard intervention to reduce study-related fatigue does not exist yet. Another potential limitation of the chosen design is lack of blinding, which may have enhanced the possibility that positive expectations of the participants influenced the results [</offsets><xref rid="pone.0152137.ref077" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="123308" xml_f="123310" txt_i="55753" txt_f="55755">77</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="123317" xml_f="124258" txt_i="55755" txt_f="56696">]. It should be noted, though, that blinding of the participants was by definition not possible, because they received an ‘active’ intervention. Researchers and trainers in the current study were not blinded as well, since practical issues relating to the wait list design did not allow us to do so. However, as our measures did not involve subjective evaluations by the researchers involved in the study, we believe our study’s findings were not biased by lack of blinding. We recommend that future randomized controlled trials employ a design and measurements that make it possible to further distillate whether specific (i.e., exercise) and/or non-specific factors (i.e., social support, placebo effect) of the intervention are responsible for the beneficial effects on study-related fatigue. For instance, a comparison between individual versus group exercise may reveal to what extent social support is responsible for positive effects.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec035"><title><offsets xml_i="124292" xml_f="124331" txt_i="56698" txt_f="56737">Theoretical and practical contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="124342" xml_f="125114" txt_i="56738" txt_f="57510">We believe the results of the present study contribute to current evidence about exercise and study-related fatigue both theoretically and practically. With respect to theoretical contributions, we were among the first to investigate the association between exercise and study-related fatigue by using a strong methodological design. We showed that regular exercise at a low intensity has major benefits compared to time alone. Moreover, these effects did not fade away and persisted till at least twelve weeks after the intervention.

Furthermore, follow-up measures imply that the intervention has the potential to promote regular exercise and accompanying beneficial effects in the longer run.

Students experiencing fatigue problems should be supported and encouraged to engage in regular exercise, for instance by offering a university exercise programs like the exercise intervention under study.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec036"><title><offsets xml_i="125841" xml_f="125863" txt_i="58160" txt_f="58182">Supporting Information</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152137.s001"><label><offsets xml_i="125951" xml_f="125971" txt_i="58183" txt_f="58203">S1 CONSORT Checklist</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="125991" xml_f="125996" txt_i="58203" txt_f="58208">(DOC)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152137.s001.doc"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="126064" xml_f="126100" txt_i="58209" txt_f="58245">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152137.s002"><label><offsets xml_i="126227" xml_f="126238" txt_i="58246" txt_f="58257">S1 Protocol</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="126262" xml_f="126299" txt_i="58257" txt_f="58294">Approval Ethics Committee (in Dutch).</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="126310" xml_f="126315" txt_i="58295" txt_f="58300">(PDF)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152137.s002.pdf"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="126383" xml_f="126419" txt_i="58301" txt_f="58337">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152137.s003"><label><offsets xml_i="126546" xml_f="126557" txt_i="58338" txt_f="58349">S2 Protocol</offsets></label><caption><title><offsets xml_i="126581" xml_f="126628" txt_i="58349" txt_f="58396">Application form Ethics Committee (in English).</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="126639" xml_f="126645" txt_i="58397" txt_f="58403">(DOCX)</offsets></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152137.s003.docx"><caption><p><offsets xml_i="126714" xml_f="126750" txt_i="58404" txt_f="58440">Click here for additional data file.</offsets></p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Simon van Woerkom and Bram Bakker for their support in designing the study, and helping us with practical issues.
