In the DJW group, 4 patients withdrew from the study due to ineffectiveness (n = 3) and transportation problem (n = 1), 1 patient was lost to follow up and another one had a traffic accident during the study. In the diclofenac group, 3 patients were lost to follow up and 3 were withdrawn due to accidents. Thus, each group comprised 94 completers. The two treatment groups were not significantly different in demographic data e.g., sex, age, weight, height, duration of OA, location of OA (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"><offsets xml_i="17796" xml_f="17797" txt_i="11884" txt_f="11885">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17804" xml_f="17970" txt_i="11885" txt_f="12051">) and base-line data for the major outcome assessment (VAS, Lequesne's functional index and time for climbing up 10 steps).

During the study, the rates of compliance with medication in the DJW group were 94%, whereas, those in the diclofenac group were 96%. Since few patients withdrew from the trial, the results were not substantially affected, whether the statistical method was performed by an intention to treat (ITT) analysis or an analysis on available completers. Thus, the following data showed the findings from the ITT analysis.</offsets></p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label><offsets xml_i="18508" xml_f="18516" txt_i="12510" txt_f="12518">Figure

Generally, a large dose of this herb is not recommended in a tropical country (such as Thailand) because of the potential aggravation of internal heat. Thus, the amount of Xixin in the DJW recipe used in this study was reduced from 7.75% to 2.5%.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44555" xml_f="46548" txt_i="24512" txt_f="26505">In an ITT analysis (and analysis on completers), the mean changes in some variables between the two groups were significantly different after the first few weeks of treatment, and became no different afterwards. These differences suggest that the onset of DJW is significantly slower than diclofenac for at least 2 weeks (with respect to walking pain, standing pain, morning stiffness, stiffness after rest, total stiffness and patients' overall opinion) or 3 weeks (with respect to Lequesne's functional index). The reason why DJW needs a few weeks to exert its effect may be due to 3 possibilities. Firstly, from the pharmacokinetic point of view, the elimination half-life of the active ingredients in DJW might be too long, and therefore needs weeks to accumulate until a steady state concentration is reached (normally 4–5 half-lives) and its maximal therapeutic effect is evident. Secondly, from the pharmacodynamic point of view, DJW may exert its effects via several probable mechanisms (similar to many novel biologic treatments of arthropathy) involved modifications of cartilage metabolism, normalized viscosity and elasticity of synovial fluid, etc. These mechanisms of action might resemble many symptomatic slow acting drugs in osteoarthritis (SYSADOA) such as glucosamine sulfate, intra-artricular hyaluronan, and others. These interventions always need a period of time to exert their therapeutic action. Thirdly, the major effect of DJW might be the result from placebo effect and/or natural fluctuation of the OA symptoms. It could be simply that diclofenac worked quickly, but patients in both groups got better anyway by 2–3 weeks. Although the last possibility cannot be entirely ruled out, but it seems unlikely because even there is a tendency of OA symptoms to improve after placebo treatment, it has been reported that diclofenac was significantly superior to placebo in relieving pain, improving stiffness, and improving physical function after 4 weeks of treatment [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"><offsets xml_i="46580" xml_f="46582" txt_i="26505" txt_f="26507">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46589" xml_f="47318" txt_i="26507" txt_f="27236">]. Furthermore, we also found that oral administration of the ethanol extract of DJW possessed both central and peripheral analgesic activities in animal model, even when the DJW extract was given in the equivalent dose used in human (mg/kg of human dose corrected by intra- and inter-specie variations) [to be published data]. In clinical practice, this slower onset of action and probable need for rescue analgesics (e.g., paracetamol as needed) during the first 2–3 weeks after initiation of DJW should be the important limitations of using DJW as an alternative treatment for OA of the knee. Moreover, the patient's compliance with such a high dosage of DJW (9 g/day or 18 capsules/day) is an important issue to be concerned.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47325" xml_f="47767" txt_i="27237" txt_f="27679">Since this study demonstrated that approximately 30% of study subjects in each group experienced adverse events, this data suggest that the toxicity profiles of DJW are similar to diclofenac. Therefore, cautious use of DJW should be considered in the same manner as using diclofenac including other NSAIDs. However, the gastrointestinal adverse effects in the diclofenac group were quite low when compared to other short-term NSAIDs studies [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18"><offsets xml_i="47799" xml_f="47801" txt_i="27679" txt_f="27681">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47808" xml_f="47809" txt_i="27681" txt_f="27682">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"><offsets xml_i="47841" xml_f="47843" txt_i="27682" txt_f="27684">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47850" xml_f="48185" txt_i="27684" txt_f="28019">]. This might be due to the exclusion of patients with a high risk of adverse effects from NSAIDs during the screening visit.
