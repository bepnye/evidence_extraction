Throughout the whole period of the SARS epidemic, a series of infection control and protective measures were employed in the two affiliated hospitals. But, why were some of HCWs infected by SARS, and some of them were not? The objective of this study was to determine which preventive measures used were effective in protecting HCWs from SARS, and which were not effective.

as SARS, but their IgG against SARS test was negative, so that they were excluded from the data analysis. Logistic regression was conducted to explore the risk factors for SARS infection among HCWs and odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess the association of SARS infection with the factors studied. Univariate analysis was performed at first for each risk factor. Factors with P &lt; 0.1 were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis and analyzed using a forward-stepwise procedure. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, age, gender, marital status, educational level, professional title, and the department in which the HCW worked were controlled as potential confounding factors.

By contrast, the windows of wards with natural ventilation and natural ventilation enhanced by an additional electronic exhaust fans were opened, and the air flow and the exchange rate of air in the wards were high, which might greatly decrease the density of the SARS virus in the wards and may also reduce the probability of HCWs contracting the virus.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43295" xml_f="43694" txt_i="20985" txt_f="21384">SARS-Cov may be shed from a SARS patient's respiratory secretion and feces, and the latter may further contaminate objects in the ward. The protective gown, gloves, multilayered cotton mask, and head and foot coverings wore by HCWs may also be contaminated while caring for SARS patients. It has been shown that SARS-Cov may remain viable for considerable periods on a dry surface (up to 24 hours) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="43726" xml_f="43728" txt_i="21384" txt_f="21386">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43735" xml_f="43864" txt_i="21386" txt_f="21515">] and is stable in feces and urine at room temperature for at least 1 to 2 days and 4 days in stool from patients with diarrhea [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19"><offsets xml_i="43896" xml_f="43898" txt_i="21515" txt_f="21517">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="43905" xml_f="44477" txt_i="21517" txt_f="22089">]. Hence, touching surfaces or objects that are contaminated with SARS-CoV may introduce the virus into the mucous membranes of the eye, nose, or possibly the mouth. It is believed that nominally 'clean' areas may be contaminated if an HCW wears a piece of protective clothing contaminated with SARS patients' secretions into the area. For this reason, HCWs must wear two layers of gown, gloves, multilayered cotton mask, head and foot covering in SARS wards and discard the outer layer before entering clean areas, in order to prevent fomite transmission to other areas [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="44509" xml_f="44511" txt_i="22089" txt_f="22091">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44518" xml_f="45019" txt_i="22091" txt_f="22592">]. This study proved that wearing two layers of gloves significantly protected HCWs from SARS compared with wearing a single layer of gloves, but we did not find that wearing double layers of gowns, multilayered cotton masks, and head and foot coverings were associated with HCWs being protected from SARS. This might be due to the fact that almost of all the procedures involved in caring for patients were done with the hands; hence gloves were more highly contaminated by SARS patients' secretions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45026" xml_f="45309" txt_i="22593" txt_f="22876">A small number of severely infected patients or super-spreading patients appeared to play a disproportionate role in the spread of the disease to HCWs.

It had been hypothesized that these patients might have a relatively depressed immune system with associated high viral loads and may be unduly facilitating transmission of the virus. In the present study, the same index patient led to the two clusters of SARS outbreaks among HCWs in the two affiliated hospitals. Statistical analysis showed that caring for a "Super-spreading Patient" significantly increased the risk of HCWs suffering from SARS. In light of this, a series of stringent infection control measures should be required when HCWs care for patients suspected of being SARS super-spreaders.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46041" xml_f="46959" txt_i="23488" txt_f="24406">Several limitations of the study ought to be mentioned here. First, our investigation was limited to two affiliated hospitals of Sun Yat-sen University. This is not representative of all of the hospitals in which patients with SARS were admitted and cared for in Guangzhou. Therefore, this is a typical case investigation. Second, ventilation in the wards was not objectively assessed for some reason, meaning that we could not exactly evaluate the influence of the ventilation in the wards on the transmission of SARS among HCWs. Third, we could not trace the tree structure of the primary, secondary, and third class cases, which prevented us from clarifying the association of the HCWs infected by SARS with the index case directly or indirectly. Fourth, some factors, such as oxygen therapy and bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation were found to be related to nosocomial infection of SARS in other study [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="46991" xml_f="46993" txt_i="24406" txt_f="24408">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47000" xml_f="47349" txt_i="24408" txt_f="24757">], were not included in the present study, which indicated that we missing an opportunity to find some effective measures for protecting HCWs from SARS or to assess their effect. Fifth, in the early stage of SARS epidemic, the diagnosis of SARS was based on the history of epidemiology, signs and symptoms suggested by the Health Ministry of China [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="47381" xml_f="47383" txt_i="24757" txt_f="24759">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47390" xml_f="48199" txt_i="24759" txt_f="25568">], not on the directive biomarkers of SARS-CoV or antibodies against SARS-CoV, which might lead to over reporting "SARS" cases or missing identifying inapparent infection or subclinical infection. This might be the reason that 80 of 90 HCWs with "SARS" and 11 of 668 subjects without "SARS" were seropositive. Sixth, some prevention measures were usually employed at the same time in SARS wards, which meant that these measures were highly correlated. In this situation, multivariate statistical analysis might omit some effective measures in the final model due to multicollinearity. Seventh, 10.8% of frontline HCWs who cared for SRAS patients were not included in the present study, which was the reason that the number of HCWs involved in intubation in the present study was less than our previous study [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><offsets xml_i="48231" xml_f="48233" txt_i="25568" txt_f="25570">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="48240" xml_f="48624" txt_i="25570" txt_f="25954">], which might cause to underestimate the association of the intubation with the nosocomial infection of SARS. Finally, although we identified several preventive measures which were effective for protecting HCWs from SARS, we could not eliminate the inefficiencies of other adopted measures, due to the fact that we utilized a retrospective rather than an interventional study design.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="48646" xml_f="48656" txt_i="25956" txt_f="25966">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48667" xml_f="48832" txt_i="25967" txt_f="26132">In summary, good air ventilation in wards and a series of simple control and preventive measures might decrease or prevent SARS transmission among HCWs in hospitals.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="48854" xml_f="48873" txt_i="26134" txt_f="26153">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48884" xml_f="48942" txt_i="26154" txt_f="26212">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="48964" xml_f="48986" txt_i="26214" txt_f="26236">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48997" xml_f="49366" txt_i="26237" txt_f="26606">W-QC contributed to study design, data analysis and paper writing.
