It is crucial for patients to cope with CHF adequately, if they are to live an acceptable life. Self-management may play an important role in this regard. Previous studies have shown the effectiveness of the 'Chronic Disease Self-Management Program' (CDSMP), a group-based cognitive behavioural programme for patients with various chronic conditions. However, the programme's effectiveness has not yet been studied specifically among CHF patients.

However, the effects of the programme have not yet been studied specifically among CHF patients. Our basic assumption is that increasing levels of self-efficacy expectancies will help CHF patients to interrupt the downward spiral of functional disability and demoralisation after their cardiac event. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the effects of the CDSMP on psychosocial attributes (e.g. self-efficacy expectancies), health behaviour, quality of life, and health care utilisation of CHF patients. The current paper presents the design of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial evaluating the CDSMP among CHF outpatients in the south of the Netherlands. The study involves an effect evaluation and an evaluation of the intervention process. The process analysis is expected to yield information on factors increasing or hampering the effectiveness and implementation of the programme in outpatient care for CHF patients, which may be crucial later on if the group programme turns out to be effective.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11109" xml_f="11113" txt_i="6471" txt_f="6475">Aims</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11124" xml_f="11463" txt_i="6476" txt_f="6815">The main objectives of the current study are: (1) to assess the effects of the cognitive behavioural CDSMP intervention on psychosocial attributes, health behaviour, quality of life, and health care utilisation of CHF patients, and (2) to assess the feasibility of the CDSMP intervention according to patients and leaders of the programme.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11491" xml_f="11505" txt_i="6818" txt_f="6832">Methods/Design</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11525" xml_f="11531" txt_i="6833" txt_f="6839">Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11542" xml_f="11933" txt_i="6840" txt_f="7231">This evaluation study is designed as a two-group randomised controlled trial in which patients are randomly allocated to the intervention or control group (the latter receiving usual care).

For the present study, however, we opted for a combination of a 'professional leader' (a CHF nurse specialist) and a 'peer leader' (CHF patient), acting as a role model for the other CHF patients in the class. The reason was that we expect a programme which is led by at least one professional leader to be easier to implement in regular health care than a programme led by two lay leaders only. Furthermore, CHF is a serious disease with unexpected exacerbations and intercurrent health problems. This means that peer leaders may only be able to conduct the programme for a limited period, which could form a threat to the continuity of the programme.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17762" xml_f="18799" txt_i="12566" txt_f="13603">In four of the six hospitals, CHF nurse specialists and CHF patients were trained as leaders.

A total of twelve professionals and eleven CHF patients received four days of training with the CDSMP protocol in the period April 2004 – November 2005. Four of the twelve professional leaders and two of the eleven peer leaders did not implement the programme in the intervention period, due to work, health, or private issues. Each of the groups in which the leaders were trained (n = 4 to 6) included both professional leaders and peer leaders, who practised together, to provide an optimal training situation. The leader training was provided by one of the researchers (author ES) and a CHF nurse specialist of the University Hospital Maastricht in the Netherlands. Both had been instructed as master trainers at Stanford University by Lorig and colleagues in March 2004. The nurse master trainer also conducted several classes in the intervention period.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18821" xml_f="18858" txt_i="13605" txt_f="13642">Measurements in the effect evaluation</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18878" xml_f="18903" txt_i="13643" txt_f="13668">Primary outcome variables</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18914" xml_f="19180" txt_i="13669" txt_f="13935">The primary outcomes of the effect evaluation are psychosocial attributes, conceptualised as self-efficacy expectancies, perceived control, and cognitive symptom management.

A total of 187 patients were allocated to the intervention group, which was according to plan. The number of patients allocated to the control group (n = 131), however, was smaller than planned. At present, follow-up data are being collected. The exact drop-out rate and related consequences for the power calculation will become clear after completion of the data collection in January 2007.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="31724" xml_f="31743" txt_i="24854" txt_f="24873">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31754" xml_f="31814" txt_i="24874" txt_f="24934">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="31836" xml_f="31858" txt_i="24936" txt_f="24958">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="31869" xml_f="32189" txt_i="24959" txt_f="25279">GK developed the project and obtained funding together with JvE and JvH.
