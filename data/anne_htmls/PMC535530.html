Physicians tailor these settings with the intention of optimizing ICD therapeutic efficacy, but the usefulness of this approach has not been studied and is unknown. Empiric programming of settings such as anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) has been demonstrated to be effective, but an empiric approach to programming all VT/VF detection and therapy settings has not been studied. A single standardized empiric programming regimen was developed based on key strategies with the intention of restricting shock delivery to circumstances when it is the only effective and appropriate therapy. The EMPIRIC trial is a worldwide, multi-center, prospective, one-to-one randomized comparison of empiric to physician tailored programming for VT/VF detection and therapy in a broad group of about 900 dual chamber ICD patients. The trial will provide a better understanding of how particular programming strategies impact the quantity of shocks delivered and facilitate optimization of complex ICD programming.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Implantable cardioverter defibrillator</kwd><kwd>ICD</kwd><kwd>shocks</kwd><kwd>programming</kwd><kwd>empiric</kwd><kwd>detection</kwd><kwd>therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5105" xml_f="5115" txt_i="1151" txt_f="1161">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5126" xml_f="5660" txt_i="1162" txt_f="1696">Over the past decade ICD implantation has become increasingly straightforward, yet ICD programming and follow up has become more complex due to device feature and capability enhancements.

Furthermore, ICD indications have dramatically changed within the last five years. Physicians may retain old programming habits even with enhanced devices or expanding patient indications, which may result in sub-optimal detection and therapy, such as unnecessary shocks for faster VT, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and non-sustained VT. Physicians often adjust many programmable settings that may benefit the patient. For example, physicians may prescribe patient-specific regimens for anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP) or shock energies based on lab testing.

This primary objective was chosen to independently evaluate the effects of programming on both appropriate and inappropriate ICD shocks (which are likely to have different implications for patient management). The advantage of this approach is that it focuses on frequency of shock delivery while also allowing an assessment of their appropriateness. However, this assessment could be confounded by a disproportionate number of SVT events in the two study groups. For example, an abundance of non-shocked SVT events in the physician-tailored arm, despite a greater incidence of inappropriate SVT shock therapies in that arm, nevertheless would result in the proportion of SVT episodes shocked being similar in the two arms. The analysis is also heavily dependent on the electrogram data stored in the ICDs. Given the electrogram storage capability of ICDs, differing rates of electrogram storage might occur between study arms or between VT/VF and SVT episodes that may skew the amount of data available for analysis. Therefore, the key secondary endpoint in this study is considered to be the time to delivery of first shock therapy in any given patient. This endpoint offers the advantage that it enables patient cross over to occur between the study arms without endpoint compromise and it is a clinically robust indicator of patient shock-related morbidity. Furthermore, its analysis is not influenced by the appropriateness or otherwise of a shock therapy and therefore cannot be confounded by differential occurrence of non-shocked SVT events in the study arms.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11338" xml_f="11586" txt_i="6911" txt_f="7159">Other secondary endpoints will further evaluate the impact of the standardized programming regimen on patients by an assessment of detection performance, health care utilization, shock impact on device longevity, and "true VT/VF" episode durations.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="11614" xml_f="11643" txt_i="7162" txt_f="7191">EMPIRIC Trial Protocol Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11654" xml_f="11942" txt_i="7192" txt_f="7480">The EMPIRIC trial is a worldwide, multi-center, prospective, one-to-one randomized comparison of empiric to physician tailored programming.

This might occur if empiric programming is perceived to be efficacious, particularly with respect to management of rapid ventricular tachycardia by pace termination. Collection of pre-trial programming practices provides the capacity to evaluate potential "treatment drift". This result will be reported. Additionally, in an effort to prevent drifting or possible physician bias to programming in the physician tailored arm, a weekly comparison of programming status and initial implant programming will be assessed through device interrogation information. Any programming changes made must be supported by a medical justification with a basis of event-related occurrences (i.e. system- or procedure-related adverse events, spontaneous episodes, or inappropriate shocks). In order to protect protocol design integrity, reprogramming will be encouraged for non-justified programming deviations. In this manner the initial treatment strategies are tested using an intention-to-treat analysis with characterization of programming changes.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17076" xml_f="17110" txt_i="11556" txt_f="11590">Empiric Arm Programming Strategies</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17121" xml_f="17228" txt_i="11591" txt_f="11698">The empiric arm standardized programming regimen is based on the following key strategies to reduce shocks.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17244" xml_f="17284" txt_i="11699" txt_f="11739">1) Strategies to reduce shocks for VT/VF</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17295" xml_f="17297" txt_i="11740" txt_f="11742">• </offsets><bold><italic><offsets xml_i="17311" xml_f="17350" txt_i="11742" txt_f="11781">Multiple ATP attempts for VT≤ 200 bpm: </offsets></italic></bold><offsets xml_i="17366" xml_f="17522" txt_i="11781" txt_f="11937">Three sequences of ATP will be attempted for rhythms with ventricular rates ≤ 200 bpm.
