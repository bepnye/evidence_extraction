Given that nicotine dependence and smoking in pregnancy is embedded within socio-economic disadvantage to such a degree, we might expect that both sets of studies within the Cochrane reviews to have a similar range of broad outcomes. However, this is only true for those studies where the intervention was social support and not for those studies examining smoking cessation advice in pregnancy. Commenting particularly on the oft-cited role of cigarettes as stress-reduction agents, Oliver states "it seems irrational to try to take away a coping mechanism and not look for any social and emotional consequences such as strained family relationships" (p275)[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="6922" xml_f="6923" txt_i="3269" txt_f="3270">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6930" xml_f="7220" txt_i="3270" txt_f="3560">].

In addition, women were given additional time with the midwife to discuss smoking cessation, and given a small booklet to take home to assist smoking cessation. Women's partners in the intervention hospital were more likely to quit compared to the partners of both a group of women in the same hospital whose smoking was monitored prior to the intervention period and to women contemporaneously observed in another hospital. The OR for partners trying to quit while the woman was pregnant in the intervention group relative to the control groups was 2.94 (1.10–7.88), representing 34.0% versus 14.9%. However, the rates of successful quitting by partners were low and not significantly different at 1.8% in the intervention group and 2.1% in the control group. Nor were there any significant differences in partners' daily cigarette consumption. At six months postpartum, there were no significant differences in attempts to quit, successful quitting, or daily cigarette consumption. Presumably, if this intervention affected the partners, it could have acted either through changing the personal interaction between the pregnant woman and her partner, or directly through sharing the self-help intervention. However, given the control group was non-randomized, any differences in partners' smoking habits could be due to inherent differences in the intervention and control groups initially, and not a result of the intervention. No currently available randomized trials have examined these issues.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9509" xml_f="9595" txt_i="5743" txt_f="5829">We have previously reported the primary outcome at the end of pregnancy and 18 months </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="9603" xml_f="9614" txt_i="5829" txt_f="5840">postpartum </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="9623" xml_f="9669" txt_i="5840" txt_f="5886">and two other secondary outcomes of the trial[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="9701" xml_f="9703" txt_i="5886" txt_f="5888">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9710" xml_f="9711" txt_i="5888" txt_f="5889">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="9743" xml_f="9745" txt_i="5889" txt_f="5891">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9752" xml_f="11082" txt_i="5891" txt_f="7221">]. Women who were still smoking at booking for antenatal care were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial to assist smoking cessation. The trial compared a standard care intervention with two different programs based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM). We found that there were small differences between the two TTM arms. Combining the two TTM arms in the analysis (as pre-planned), the OR (95% confidence intervals (CI)) for stopping smoking at 30 of gestation weeks were 2.09 (0.90–4.85) for 10-week sustained abstinence and 2.92 (1.42–6.03) for point prevalence abstinence relative to controls. At 10 days after delivery, the OR (95%CI) for quitting were 2.81 (1.11–7.13) and 1.85 (1.00–3.41) for 10-week and point prevalence abstinence respectively. The absolute benefit of the intervention was low because only 3% or so of women managed sustained abstinence. Nevertheless, there was some evidence that the intervention benefited women's smoking, but what effect did the intervention have on women's social functioning and their partners' smoking habits? These were pre-planned secondary outcomes. The trial was not explicitly designed to influence these outcomes, but had elements of the intervention that made it plausible that it might do so and we were responding to the calls described above to report these outcomes.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="11123" xml_f="11130" txt_i="7223" txt_f="7230">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11141" xml_f="11305" txt_i="7231" txt_f="7395">We obtained ethical approval from the relevant NHS ethical committees.

Women were offered three pieces of advice-to acknowledge the person's concern reflected in the nagging, to tell the person that stopping smoking is a personal decision, and to remind the person that stopping smoking takes a lot of energy and stopping the nagging would allow them to consider whether stopping smoking was the right thing to do or not. In Contemplation, women were asked to imagine themselves as a non-smoker. In this guided imagining, women were told to think of the praise that family and friends might give if they stopped smoking. In Preparation, women were advised to set up a support team to help them quit (and write this down). They were asked to get the support team to congratulate them for every day without cigarettes. The Action manual emphasized the support team in the same way. In Maintenance, women were advised to anticipate the stressors they might face and make a plan of how to deal with those. They were offered a menu of items as a prompt, including 'Don't be afraid to ask for help.' The value of thinking through new ways of doing familiar tasks was also emphasized. Most of this advice described above was followed by blank areas of the book where women could write down their personal plans. Thus women in Arm B received much more advice and support to increase social support and create more positive environment than did women in Arm A.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19015" xml_f="19187" txt_i="14468" txt_f="14640">Women in Arm C would have therefore had at least the same content as women in Arm B on social support.

Several processes involve social interaction. These are social liberation, which includes the creation of new social opportunities, stimulus control, which includes the control over social stimuli to smoke, and helping relationships, which means creating therapeutic relationships and enhancing the rapport in existing relationships.

usually involve quitters making changes to their social world. Hence all smoking cessation interventions have the potential to have effects on individuals other than the quitter. Smoking cessation interventions in pregnancy might be particularly able to do so because of the shared social change implied by the pregnancy for the partners involved[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="34134" xml_f="34136" txt_i="25739" txt_f="25741">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34143" xml_f="35240" txt_i="25741" txt_f="26838">]. The smoking cessation intervention in this trial had beneficial effects on women's smoking. Although the intervention did not primarily aim to influence the social world of the woman concerned and were not the major component of the intervention, the more intensive stage-based advice arms did contain considerably more advice on how to make changes than did the standard care arm. Additionally, women in the TTM-based intervention arms took home an attractive set of self-help books that they could have shared with their partner, although they were not given specific advice to do so, more than twice as many women did this in the most intensive advice arm. There was no evidence from this trial that such computerized advice and self-help literature resulted in more of the women's partners quitting smoking or women receiving more social aid provision from those around them in the intensive advice arms of the trial, however. Nevertheless, the data do emphasise that many of those women making sustained changes to their smoking behaviour were accompanied by their partners doing likewise.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35247" xml_f="35801" txt_i="26839" txt_f="27393">There seems little scope for bias to explain these results. Approximately 42% of all potential smokers were recruited into the study. To explain these negative results by this potential bias, we would have to postulate that among the majority of non-recruits, the TTM-based intervention would have influenced social support mobilization and partner quitting favourably relative to the control intervention, but did not do so among those women recruited. Given the main reason that women were not recruited was due to midwives inactivity within the trial[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="35833" xml_f="35835" txt_i="27393" txt_f="27395">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35842" xml_f="36126" txt_i="27395" txt_f="27679">], rather than a characteristic of the women themselves, there seems to be no reason to suspect bias from this source, though it clearly cannot be excluded. Once women were recruited, the cluster randomization resulted in good balance of the characteristics of women between the arms[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="36158" xml_f="36160" txt_i="27679" txt_f="27681">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36167" xml_f="36842" txt_i="27681" txt_f="28356">], so bias from this source is unlikely also. Around 80% of women had data on change in partners' smoking habits and around 70% on change in ISSB. Clearly, if women with absent data in Arm A were different to women with absent data in Arm B or C, then bias could result. However, reassuringly, while women with fewer educational qualifications were more liable to have missing data, this effect was similar in all three arms, and bias from this source therefore also seems unlikely. It must be acknowledged that the trial had little power to exclude a worthwhile effect on partners' quitting, though it had ample power to detect small differences in social support provision.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36849" xml_f="37020" txt_i="28357" txt_f="28528">The quit rate among pregnant women's partners was low, at 4–6%.

Our trial data suggest that standard interventions, even those with potential to influence the partner, such as by self-help manuals used in our study, do not currently influence partners' smoking. Nevertheless, it is striking that one quarter to one third of pregnant women that stopped smoking lived with partners that also stopped. Perhaps future interventions need to test interventions that intervene on both partners in pregnancy, and not the pregnant woman alone. A qualitative study found evidence that the issue of men's smoking was not usually addressed in antenatal clinics even when the man and pregnant woman attended together. Furthermore, men reported that they would have generally welcomed support to stop smoking in that context[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="38411" xml_f="38413" txt_i="29731" txt_f="29733">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38420" xml_f="38422" txt_i="29733" txt_f="29735">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38429" xml_f="38701" txt_i="29736" txt_f="30008">The issue of the effect of in-pregnancy smoking cessation advice on the social functioning of women has not, to our knowledge, been addressed in any previous study.

Compared to women who either had never smoked or quit smoking in pregnancy, continuing smokers were more likely to exhibit problem behaviour by creating interpersonal difficulties, display problems in adaptive functioning, and engage in problematic health behaviours. Given that nicotine addiction and smoking throughout pregnancy is embedded in this constellation of problem behaviours and social disadvantage, it is unsurprising that even well-placed advice to change one's social world had negligible effect on the smokers enrolled in this trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39316" xml_f="39326" txt_i="30564" txt_f="30574">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39337" xml_f="39961" txt_i="30575" txt_f="31199">This self-help and midwife intervention had a small beneficial effect on women's smoking, but no benefit on either partners' smoking or on women's social functioning. More comprehensive interventions to address factors outside of the pregnant woman's smoking may have effects on family functioning and might therefore influence women's smoking more effectively also. In particular, given that a large minority of women who stopped successfully also lived with a partner who stopped, interventions that target both partners in pregnancy might be the most effective means of protecting the fetus and the child into the future.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39983" xml_f="39996" txt_i="31201" txt_f="31214">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40007" xml_f="40033" txt_i="31215" txt_f="31241">TTM Transtheoretical Model</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40040" xml_f="40053" txt_i="31242" txt_f="31255">OR Odds ratio</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40060" xml_f="40082" txt_i="31256" txt_f="31278">CI Confidence interval</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40089" xml_f="40136" txt_i="31279" txt_f="31326">ISSB Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40143" xml_f="40182" txt_i="31327" txt_f="31366">NHS National Health Service (of the UK)</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40189" xml_f="40210" txt_i="31367" txt_f="31388">SD Standard deviation</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40217" xml_f="40255" txt_i="31389" txt_f="31427">MLwiN Multilevel Modelling for Windows</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="40277" xml_f="40296" txt_i="31429" txt_f="31448">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40307" xml_f="40367" txt_i="31449" txt_f="31509">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="40389" xml_f="40411" txt_i="31511" txt_f="31533">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40422" xml_f="40803" txt_i="31534" txt_f="31915">The trial was designed by Terry Lawrence, KK Cheng, Olga Evans, and Paul Aveyard.
