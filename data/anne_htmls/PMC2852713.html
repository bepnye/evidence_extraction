All evaluations took place between October 2004 and September 2007. We excluded pregnant women, patients with suspicious gastrointestinal obstruction, patients with any implanted electromedical device (e.g., cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator), and patients less than 18 years old. When capsule endoscopy was scheduled, the patients were assigned to Group A, B, or C by using randomization lists. Group A fasted overnight before swallowing the mouth-to-anus (M2A) capsule (Given Imaging, Yoqneam, Israel) in the morning, without any supplementary bowel preparation. Group B self-administered two bottles of oral NaP, 2 bottles (45 mL each; Solin®, Korea Pharma Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) with water, drinking one bottle at 3:00 p.m. and the second at 7:00 p.m. the day before the procedure; Group B patients were also asked to drink at least 2 L of clear liquid before midnight on the day before the procedure. Group C ingested 2 L of a PEG/electrolyte lavage solution (Colyte®, Taejoon Pharm Co., Ltd., Seoul, Korea) 16 h before the procedure. All patients were requested to ingest a liquid diet after a regular breakfast the day before the procedure and were allowed to drink clear liquid for 2 h and have a liquid diet for 4 h after swallowing the capsule. At least two expert endoscopists, unaware of the type of bowel preparation, evaluated the capsule endoscopy findings. The gastric emptying time (GET) and the small intestinal transit time (SITT) were automatically calculated.

The intestinal mucosa was defined as clean if, at any time, less than 25% of the mucosal surface was covered by intestinal contents, concentrated bile, intraluminal gas, and food. By using a timer, investigators recorded the exact time period during which the small intestinal mucosa was not clean. The percentage of the SITT during which the small intestinal mucosa was not clean was then calculated as an objective score. Small bowel cleansing was considered "adequate" if the objective score was less than 10% and "inadequate" if the score was 10% or greater.

Prior to the study, we calculated the required sample sized based on the findings of previous studies. However, because these studies were few in number and also relied upon small sample sizes, our sample size have been insufficient to detect differences between the preparations studied.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19870" xml_f="20174" txt_i="13045" txt_f="13349">Unfortunately, as there is no gold standard for capsule endoscopy recordings, capsule endoscopy is not always diagnostic, and a significant number of false positive and false negative findings occur.

In the present study, we were not able to confirm all positive findings obtained via capsule endoscopy by means of surgery, enteroscopy, or other studies. Further evaluation for obscure GI bleeding was only done in 4 patients from Group A, 10 from Group B, and 7 from Group C respectively. Final diagnosis based on further evaluation agreed with the findings of capsule endoscopy, and there was no change in the initial diagnosis during follow-up of patients who were diagnosed by capsule endoscopy findings alone. For suspicious findings, further evaluation was done 4 in Group A, 1 in Group B, and 1 Group C which showed the false positive results of capsule endoscopy and the initial diagnosis was changed in these patients. Therefore, for patients who showed suspicious findings, we recommend performing additional studies. No significant difference was observed among groups for the diagnostic yield in non-obscure GI bleeding. We interpreted these results based on the fact that the most common indications were chronic abdominal pain and diarrhea, which were possibly due to functional disease, such as irritable disease, as opposed to organic disease. It is unclear whether the method of preparation influences GET, SITT, or cecal completion rate.

Our study was multi-center study with multiple investigators. Images of all capsule endoscopies were not reviewed by all investigators; at least two investigators from each hospital reviewed the images from their cases alone. Therefore, our study results may reflect inter-observer differences. The kappa value may have decreased in response to the relatively small sizes at each hospital and the fact that not all investigators reviewed the study design. However, to reduce such inter-observer differences, the authors called a meeting before the start of the study to thoroughly objectify evaluation of images.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22562" xml_f="23612" txt_i="15609" txt_f="16659">Many aspects of preparation for capsule endoscopy is not established. Previous studies on preparation for capsule endoscopy have been extremely heterogeneous in terms of type of preparation, dose, and time of administration. In addition, the evaluation system for bowel cleanliness tends to differ for each study, because methods for assessing the quality of images are chosen arbitrarily. Future comparative studies to determine the optimal preparation method for capsule endoscopy will require an objective, standardized method to evaluate cleanliness. It is our hope that additional studies on preparation methods for capsule endoscopy, ideally examining several preparatory methods and purgative agents (including prokinetics) will be continued, so that we can compare the results with our own. In this study, no significant difference wa observed between the NaP and PEG groups in terms of visualization of the small bowel. However, preparation with NaP before capsule endoscopy improved mucosal visualization compared to 12-h overnight fasting.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23619" xml_f="23990" txt_i="16660" txt_f="17031">In conclusion, the results of our prospective study suggest that bowel preparation with NaP improves the quality of capsule endoscopy images. Nevertheless, no significant difference in diagnostic yield was observed among groups. Additional, larger scale studies on the effect of various bowel preparation methods on the diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy are required.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by the <funding-source>Altana Research Fund</funding-source> in association with the
