PHR and control group patients were well matched in terms of socio-demographic characteristics and pre-stroke ability. At six months after admission, 119 (97%) patients responded to the questionnaire. Just over half (56%, 13) of intervention group patients recalled receiving a PHR. Of those patients, 59% reported reading the PHR, 27% had lost their PHR, and two-thirds said they had difficulties encouraging staff to write in the PHR. Half felt that possession of the PHR was more trouble than it was worth. PHR group patients were more satisfied with the recovery they had made (79% vs. 59%, p=0.04), but felt less able to talk to staff about their problems (61% vs. 82%, p=0.02). PHR group patients reported receiving fewer explanations about their condition (18% vs. 33%, p=0.12) and treatment (26% vs. 45%, p=0.07), and were more afraid of asking doctors questions (21% vs. 4%, p=0.01) than controls.

As many people are involved in the care of stroke patients, possession of a PHR might give patients the confidence to ask questions of staff and they might receive more explanation. A PHR used by all members of the rehabilitation team, both in and out of hospital, could improve communication between team members. Consequently, our main hypothesis was that stroke patients with a PHR would be more satisfied with their care and would receive better planned care than those without a PHR.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="7901" xml_f="7908" txt_i="3904" txt_f="3911">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7919" xml_f="8881" txt_i="3912" txt_f="4874">A controlled comparison study with a control-intervention-control (A1-B-A2) time series design was used.

Our hypothesis that the PHR would increase patient satisfaction is not supported by our findings. It is possible that the time series design was responsible for these disappointing findings. Non-randomised comparisons run the risk of introducing selection bias and fail to control for other potentially confounding factors that may bias assessment of outcomes. In this case, while our patient case mix was similar at baseline, the mortality rate was a little lower in the PHR intervention phase and more people were admitted to general medical wards. However, adjustment for age, sex, race, admission ward and Barthel index did not materially alter out findings. The inclusion of a second control phase following withdrawal of the intervention strengthens a time series design and permits any non-specific effects not associated with intervention to be evaluated.

As death rates were higher than anticipated, our effective sample size for most comparisons was reduced but was still sufficiently powerful to detect clinically important differences of about 30% in satisfaction. It is possible that PHRs were given to patients who were simply too sick to use them, but we attempted to enter all available patients into the study to assess the usefulness of the PHR for all stroke patients.

Some difficulties in its use may be attributed to the high turnover of staff and routine rotation of therapists, but most therapy staff had been involved in the design and inception of the PHR and certainly wanted it to work. Although all of the medical consultants managing stroke patients agreed for their patients to be studied, none of them acted as "champions" for the innovation.
