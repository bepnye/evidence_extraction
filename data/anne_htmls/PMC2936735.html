Despite considerable progress that has been achieved in the recent past in the diagnosis, prevention, and therapy of hospital-acquired infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) continues to create complications during the course of treatment in the case of a significant proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Mortality rates among patients with VAP have been reported to be increasing at alarming proportions to register a mortality rate of as high as 72%, and the morbidity associated with VAP is also observed to be considerably contributing to the increase in the number of days of hospital stay as well as to the enormous increase in the healthcare costs.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1"><offsets xml_i="6029" xml_f="6030" txt_i="2850" txt_f="2851">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6037" xml_f="6038" txt_i="2851" txt_f="2852">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6045" xml_f="6692" txt_i="2853" txt_f="3500">Many risk factors have been associated with VAP, which include among others the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), airway intubation, reduced conscious state, intracranial monitoring, airway reintubation, mechanical ventilation greater than 7 days, use of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and supine patient positioning. Airway intubation and mechanical ventilation, in particular, reduce the normal clearance of airway secretions, increasing the risk of VAP.

The evidence in support of these techniques is inconsistent and variable, and the literature on this account seems to abound with confusion and conflicts. The clinical effectiveness of chest physiotherapy for pneumonia is controversial. Some clinical studies have concluded that chest physiotherapy does not hasten the resolution of pneumonia.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT30"><offsets xml_i="36142" xml_f="36144" txt_i="23130" txt_f="23132">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36151" xml_f="36297" txt_i="23132" txt_f="23278">] However, there has been a lack of systematic review or meta-analysis of chest physiotherapy for pneumonia, and no study has been published yet.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14"><offsets xml_i="36331" xml_f="36333" txt_i="23278" txt_f="23280">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36340" xml_f="36341" txt_i="23280" txt_f="23281">]</offsets></p><p><italic><offsets xml_i="36356" xml_f="36369" txt_i="23282" txt_f="23295">In conclusion</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="36378" xml_f="37081" txt_i="23295" txt_f="23998">, this study of critically ill patients who were subjected to intubation and receiving mechanical ventilation demonstrated that twice-daily multimodality chest physiotherapy in the form of MH, endotracheal suctioning (OSS), chest wall vibrations, and semi-recumbent patient positioning to 30–45° of elevation was associated with decrease in CPIS scores in the study group as compared to the control group suggesting a decrease in the occurrence of VAP and mortality rate. Further study in the form of larger randomized controlled trials using combination of various chest physiotherapy techniques is suggested to confirm these findings which hold the most therapeutic potential in the prevention of VAP.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of
