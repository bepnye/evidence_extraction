Both tests consist of seven pairs of random number sequences that the assessor reads aloud at the rate of one per second. The sequence begins with three digits and increases by one at a time up to a length of nine digits. The test includes two sequences of each length and testing ceases when the participant fails to recollect any two with the same length. The score recorded, ranging from 0 to 14, is the number of successful sequences. For the verbal digits forward test, the participant's task is to repeat each sequence exactly as it is given. For the verbal digits backward test, the participant's task is to repeat each sequence in the reversed order. The difference between the verbal digits forward test score and the verbal digits backward test score was used as an index of the central executive component of working memory.

For the Stroop Test, there were three conditions. First, participants were instructed to read out words printed in black ink (e.g., BLUE). Second, they were instructed to read out the colour of coloured-X's. Finally, they were shown a page with colour-words printed in incongruent coloured inks (e.g., the word "BLUE" printed in red ink). Participants were asked to name the ink colour in which the words are printed (while ignoring the word itself). There were 80 trials for each condition and we recorded the time participants took to read each condition. The ability to selectively attend and control response output was calculated as the time difference between the third condition and the second condition.

Change in the three executive functions was calculated by subtracting the trial completion value from the baseline value. Experimental group, age, global cognition, baseline gait speed, and the change in dominant quadriceps strength were statistically controlled by entering these four variables into the regression model first.

Future prospective studies are needed to test whether the present findings also apply to larger, more heterogeneous populations. Finally, because the effect of selective attention and conflict resolution and falls-related self-efficacy observed in this study was small, future studies are also needed to determine the clinical significance, if any, of the additional and unique variance accounted for by each factor.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="40605" xml_f="40616" txt_i="25670" txt_f="25681">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="40627" xml_f="40874" txt_i="25682" txt_f="25929">In conclusion, both change in executive functions and falls-related self-efficacy are independently associated with improved gait speed.
