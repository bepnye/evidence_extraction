These pressure swings are attenuated by the time they reach the alveolar level, resulting in very small delivered tidal volumes. HFOV is theoretically ideal for lung protection, as this minimal tidal variation in alveolar volume may allow clinicians to recruit the lung, minimising atelectrauma and oxygen toxicity, while still avoiding volutrauma from tidal overdistension. However, potential drawbacks to HFOV also exist, most notably the fact that the majority of adults must have their spontaneous respiratory efforts suppressed since their inspiratory flow demands are often greater than the constant flow of gas in the circuit. This need for heavy sedation (and frequently neuromuscular blockade) means that HFOV may not be an appropriate therapy for patients with mild forms of acute lung injury.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="4480" xml_f="4537" txt_i="2142" txt_f="2199">An extensively studied and accepted therapy in neonates [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="4568" xml_f="4569" txt_i="2199" txt_f="2200">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4576" xml_f="4785" txt_i="2200" txt_f="2409">], HFOV is still an emerging ventilator mode in adults.

Unfortunately the trial was stopped early, after recruiting only 61 patients because of declining enrolment, and a further 11% of subjects had incomplete follow-up for the primary endpoint. Although no differences were detected in any primary or secondary endpoint, this study only had sufficient power to detect extreme differences in outcome between groups. This low power was further eroded by the fact that 18% of patients crossed over to the alternative therapy, making detection of a difference between groups highly improbable.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6360" xml_f="7054" txt_i="3782" txt_f="4476">Interpretation of these results is further complicated by the fact that the two treatment groups differed significantly in numbers as well as in baseline hypoxia (oxygenation index of 25 in the HFOV group, versus 18 in the control group). Furthermore, comparison and integration of these results with the existing body of knowledge regarding HFOV in ARDS are made more difficult by the lack of very explicit ventilation protocols. Because it is very clearly how a ventilator mode is used, not just which mode is chosen, clear descriptions of the ventilator protocols and the adherence to them are essential for interpreting the results of comparative trials of ventilation strategies and modes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7061" xml_f="7138" txt_i="4477" txt_f="4554">Despite these limitations, the study does generate some new hypotheses.

As discussed by the authors, this finding may relate to the fact that the 'safe' window for lung protective mechanical ventilation, in which both overdistension and cyclical tidal recruitment and derecruitment are avoided, is so narrow in severe lung injury that conventional ventilation is no longer able to accomplish the goals of lung protection. The implications of this finding are for future investigators to consider stratifying the randomisation of patients by oxygenation index, or indeed to limiting enrolment to those patients with the most severe forms of ARDS [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="7974" xml_f="7975" txt_i="5342" txt_f="5343">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7982" xml_f="8259" txt_i="5343" txt_f="5620">].
