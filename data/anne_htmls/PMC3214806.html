Ruptured aneurysms should be treated urgently (within 72 h of bleeding) to prevent rerupture. After the results of the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) study were released, endovascular coiling has becoming increasingly common for the treatment of intracranial ruptured aneurysms over the past decade. The best management for the unruptured intracranial aneurysms remains unclear to date. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) is one of the most powerful tools to provide the best evidence for making clinical decisions. Unfortunately, there is scarce RCT evidence on the management of intracranial aneurysms. The goal of this article is to provide a brief review on RCT for the treatment of intracranial ruptured or unruptured aneurysms.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4569" xml_f="4633" txt_i="1699" txt_f="1763">Randomized Controlled Trials for Ruptured Intracranial Aneurysms</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4644" xml_f="4798" txt_i="1764" txt_f="1918">Endovascular occlusion with detachable platinum coils has become an established treatment for managing patients who have ruptured intracranial aneurysms (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="4829" xml_f="4830" txt_i="1918" txt_f="1919">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4837" xml_f="4838" txt_i="1919" txt_f="1920">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="4869" xml_f="4870" txt_i="1920" txt_f="1921">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4877" xml_f="5138" txt_i="1921" txt_f="2182">).

The study included 109 patients with acute (&lt; 72 hours) aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who were suitable for both endovascular coiling and surgical clipping. Aneurysms were considered suitable for both coiling and clipping if: 1) the neck of the aneurysm was smaller than the fundus; 2) it was not a fusiform aneurysm; 3) the neck of the aneurysm and relationship to the parent vessel was distinguishable; and 4) the diameter of the aneurysm was bigger than the smallest coil, or 2 mm, resulting in approximately half of the patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage suitable for randomization. The study assessed the angiographic outcome and clinical outcome at 3 and 12 months. As an immediate postembolization angiographic result, posterior circulation aneurysms showed more complete occlusion with coiling than with surgery (p = 0.045), whereas anterior circulation (anterior cerebral artery, anterior communicating aneurysm, and pericallosal artery) aneurysms showed the better angiographic outcome with surgical clipping than with endovascular coiling (p = 0.005). The procedure-related mortality rate was 2% in the endovascular group and 4% in the surgical group. One patient had early rebleeding after incomplete coil embolization. At 12 months, the clinical outcome did not significantly differ between two groups, as 79% of endovascular versus 75% of surgical patients had good or moderate recovery on Glasgow outcome scale (p = 0.3). As 12-month angiographic results, 76.9% of the endovascular group showed total obliteration of the aneurysm, whereas 86.0% of the surgical group showed total obliteration, which was not statistically significant. The authors concluded that the clinical outcome at 3 and 12 months was comparable after endovascular and surgical treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7327" xml_f="7471" txt_i="4204" txt_f="4348">ISAT was a randomized, multicenter trial compared surgical clipping with endovascular coiling in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="7502" xml_f="7503" txt_i="4348" txt_f="4349">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7510" xml_f="7511" txt_i="4349" txt_f="4350">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="7542" xml_f="7543" txt_i="4350" txt_f="4351">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7550" xml_f="8137" txt_i="4351" txt_f="4938">).

Two-hundred-fifty of 1,063 (23.5%) patients allocated to endovascular coiling were dead or dependent at 1 year, compared with 326 of 1,055 (30.9%) patients allocated to surgical clipping: an absolute risk reduction of 7.4% (95% CI 3.6% to 11.2%, p = 0.0019). The early survival advantage in the coiled group was maintained for up to 7 years and was statistically significant (log rank p = 0.03).The risk of epilepsy was substantially lower with endovascular coiling than with clipping: relative risk 0.52 (95% CI 0.37 to 0.74). There was no significant difference in the frequency of rebleeding between the groups (log rank p = 0.22). The rebleeding risk after 1 year in the coiled group is approximately 0.2% per patient year with follow-up from 1 to 8 years with a mean of 4 years. ISAT concluded that endovascular coiling of ruptured intracranial aneurysms, when a patient is in good clinical grade and the aneurysm anatomy is suitable for endovascular treatment, is more likely than neurosurgical treatment to lead to independent survival at l year. Since the 1-year results of ISAT study were released, treatment of patients with a ruptured intracranial aneurysm has changed significantly over the past decade. In many centers, coiling has become the mainstay of treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms when both coiling and clipping are considered suitable.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9591" xml_f="9649" txt_i="6331" txt_f="6389">The long-term follow-up results of ISAT were published in </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="9657" xml_f="9677" txt_i="6389" txt_f="6409">The Lancet Neurology</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="9686" xml_f="9696" txt_i="6409" txt_f="6419"> in 2009 (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="9727" xml_f="9728" txt_i="6419" txt_f="6420">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9735" xml_f="11137" txt_i="6420" txt_f="7822">). At 5 years, the proportion of independent survivors did not differ between the two groups. Six-hundred-twenty-six of 755 (83%) patients treated by endovascular coiling were independent at 1 year, compared with 584 of 713 (82%) patients treated by surgical clipping. However, the risk of death was still significantly lower in the coiling group than in the clipping group (relative risk 0.77, 95% CI 0.61-0.98; p = 0.03). At 5 years, 112 of 1,046 (11%) patients in the coiling group have died, compared with 144 of 1,041 (14%) patients in the clipping group (log rank, p = 0.03). The annual risk of the treated aneurysm rebleeding is higher in the patients treated by the coiling than in those treated by the clipping: 10 rebleeding occurred in the coiling group and 3 in the clipping group. However, the risk remains low and is at a similar level to the risk of further subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from another source, either a pre-existing aneurysm or a newly formed aneurysm. The main finding of the study is that rates of independence become essentially equivalent at 5 years, whereas mortality rates still favor the patients treated by endovascular coiling. The major contribution to the achievement of equivalent long-term functional outcomes might be the continuing improvement in the neurological function of less severely disabled patients in the clipping group between year 2 and year 5. </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="11169" xml_f="11176" txt_i="7822" txt_f="7829">Table 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11183" xml_f="11471" txt_i="7829" txt_f="8117"> summarizes the 1-year and 5-year clinical outcomes of ISAT study.

A RCT is ongoing to answer the question whether active treatment can improve the outcome of patients with UIA as compared with observation.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Qureshi</surname><given-names>AI</given-names></name><name><surname>Janardhan</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Hanel</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Lanzino</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of endovascular and surgical treatments for intracranial aneurysms: an evidence-based review</article-title><source>Lancet Neurol</source><year>2007</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>816</fpage><lpage>825</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17706565</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Raja</surname><given-names>PV</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Germanwala</surname><given-names>AV</given-names></name><name><surname>Gailloud</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Murphy</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name><name><surname>Tamargo</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Microsurgical clipping and endovascular coiling of intracranial aneurysms: a critical review of the literature</article-title><source>Neurosurgery</source><year>2008</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>1187</fpage><lpage>1202</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18824986</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>van der Schaaf</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Algra</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wermer</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Molyneux</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Clarke</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>van Gijn</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal></etal></person-group><article-title>Endovascular coiling versus neurosurgical clipping for patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source><year>2005</year><issue>4</issue><fpage>CD003085</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16235314</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vanninen</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Koivisto</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Saari</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Hernesniemi</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Vapalahti</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ruptured intracranial aneurysms: acute endovascular treatment with Electrolytically detachable coils -
