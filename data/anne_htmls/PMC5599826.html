muscle strength, balance, and physical factors in falls of elderly women. [Subjects and
Methods] Thirty subjects were randomly assigned to AR group (AR, n=10), yoga group (yoga,
n=10), and self-exercise group (self, n=10). For 12 weeks, these groups were given lessons
related to AR-based otago exercise including strengthening, balance training, or yoga
three times a week (60 minutes each time) and self-exercise using elastic band exercise
program. [Results] Knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion strength were significantly
improved in all three groups (AR, yoga, and self-exercise groups). Regarding balance, eye
open center of pressure-x (EO CoP-x) was significantly decreased in AR group and yoga
group. However, eye close CoP-x, eye open standard deviation-x (EO SD-x), and eye open
height of ellipse (EO HoE) were only significantly decreased in AR group. AR group also
showed meaningfully improved results in morse fall scale. [Conclusion] Augmented
reality-based otago exercise can improve muscle strength, balance, and physical factors in
elderly women to prevent falls.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Aged</kwd><kwd>Augmented reality</kwd><kwd>Fall</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="4644" xml_f="4656" txt_i="1183" txt_f="1195">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4667" xml_f="4818" txt_i="1196" txt_f="1347">For the elderly, 27.7% of those in their 70s, 46.4% of those in their 80s, and 64.8% of

is a repeated resistance exercise. It might have prevented inactivity in the elderly. With
