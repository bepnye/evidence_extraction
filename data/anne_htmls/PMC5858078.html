The protective cover of the head was in contact with the labial surfaces of the teeth during imaging. This disposable protective cover was recommended by the manufacturer to avoid cross-contamination. The image of each surface was recorded by special software (DBSWIN Imaging Software; Durr Dental). This software creates images of 720 × 576 pixels. The fluorescent images are quantified from green (approximately 510 nm wavelength) to red (approximately 680 nm wavelength) and a numerical value from 0 to 3 is assigned to each image corresponding to the lesion severity. According to the manufacturer, the values in the range of 0–1.0 indicate healthy tooth enamel, whereas those in the range of 1.0–1.5 are representative for early-stage enamel caries. For each WSL, the highest value in the range of 1.0–1.5 was recorded, corresponding to the lowest amount of mineral content.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="17051" xml_f="18157" txt_i="11608" txt_f="12714">The Vita Easyshade spectrophotometer (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany) was employed for color assessment of WSLs. The device was calibrated before each appointment using a white table supplied by the manufacturer. Tooth color was measured by holding the probe tip at a right angle to the surface and the values were reported according to the CIELAB (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage L* a* and b*) color space system. In this system, the “L” axis represents the degree of lightness, whereas the “a” and “b” values indicate positions on red/green (+a = red, −a = green) and yellow/blue (+b = yellow, −b = blue) axis, respectively. For each tooth, the color assessment was performed at the central area of WSL and also on healthy tooth structure. To minimize measurement errors, the assessments were repeated three times, and the mean values of three consecutive measurements were recorded for each area. The color assessment was repeated in the same conditions at the follow-up appointments. The color difference between WSL and sound tooth surface was calculated using the following formula:</offsets></p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="DRJ-15-95-g001.jpg"></inline-graphic></p><p><offsets xml_i="18236" xml_f="18414" txt_i="12716" txt_f="12894">The outcome assessor was kept blinded to the treatment groups.

This outcome indicates that MI Paste Plus and Remin Pro have remineralizing effects on enamel caries and can effectively reduce the extent of WSLs in a 3-month treatment period. It is believed that MI Paste Plus can maintain a state of supersaturation of calcium and phosphate over the enamel surface.
