When remifentanil was administered with an effect-site concentration of 4 ng/mL, SBP, DBP, MAP and HR did not significantly change compared with the baseline values measured before induction. The experiment was stopped in only one patient (4.8%) in group R4 and this was the lowest rate among the 3 groups. When remifentanil was administered with an effect-site concentration of 2 ng/mL, SBP, DBP, MAP and HR increased significantly compared with baseline values. The tachycardia or hypertension that was profound enough to discontinue the experiment occurred in 5 of 23 cases (21.7%). Given these findings, it can be assumed that remifentanil at 2 ng/mL did not effectively block increases in SBP, DBP, MAP and HR induced by desflurane. On the other hand, administration of 6 ng/mL decreased SBP, DBP and MAP significantly compared to baseline values. The number of cases that required cessation of the experiment due to hypotension or bradycardia was 3 out of 20 cases (15%). Based on these results, it appears that 6 ng/mL may not be the proper remifentanil concentration for the maintenance of hemodynamic stability. However, no significant differences in the number of patients with side effects were noted among these groups which may be partly due to our small sample sizes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20734" xml_f="21111" txt_i="14720" txt_f="15097">In this study, BP and HR showed significant differences among the 3 groups during the initial 3 minutes of desflurane inhalation at about 1 to 1.5 MAC.

It has not been elucidated whether or not the effect-site concentration of 4 ng/mL of remifentanil, required for hemodynamic stability, diminishes the responses of the sympathetic nervous system. Evidences that fentanyl and alfentanil may attenuate hemodynamic responses without blunting sympathetic nervous system activation suggest the need for further research on effects of sympathetic nervous system suppression by remifentanil.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="27988" xml_f="27989" txt_i="20895" txt_f="20896">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="27996" xml_f="27997" txt_i="20896" txt_f="20897">.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="28028" xml_f="28029" txt_i="20897" txt_f="20898">9</offsets></xref></p><p><offsets xml_i="28043" xml_f="28250" txt_i="20899" txt_f="21106">Third, our study has no control group.
