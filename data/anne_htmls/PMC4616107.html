normal muscles versus muscles with latent or active myofascial trigger points, and
identified the neuromuscular physiological characteristics of muscles with active
myofascial trigger points, thereby providing a quantitative evaluation of myofascial pain
syndrome and clinical foundational data for its diagnosis. [Subjects] Ninety adults in
their 20s participated in this study. Subjects were equally divided into three groups: the
active myofascial trigger point group, the latent myofascial trigger point group, and the
control group. [Methods] Maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), endurance, median
frequency (MDF), and muscle fatigue index were measured in all subjects. [Results] No
significant differences in MVIC or endurance were revealed among the three groups.
However, the active trigger point group had significantly different MDF and muscle fatigue
index compared with the control group. [Conclusion] Given that muscles with active
myofascial trigger points had an increased MDF and suffered muscle fatigue more easily,
increased recruitment of motor unit action potential of type II fibers was evident.
Therefore, electrophysiological analysis of these myofascial trigger points can be applied
to evaluate the effect of physical therapy and provide a quantitative diagnosis of
myofascial pain syndrome.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Electromyography</kwd><kwd>Electrophysiological characteristics</kwd><kwd>Myofascial trigger point</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="4756" xml_f="4768" txt_i="1436" txt_f="1448">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4779" xml_f="4984" txt_i="1449" txt_f="1654">Myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) can be caused by frequent muscle or fascial stiffness as a

Subjects in the latent myofascial trigger point group were those not diagnosed with MPS but
who felt tenderness when the upper trapezius was stimulated. Subjects in the control group
had no voluntary pain or tenderness. Mean age, height, and weight, respectively, were 23.27

the 50% MDF from 100% MDF was divided into 100% MDF. The sampling rate for the surface EMG
