To date, the main pathophysiology of vasovagal syncope is thought to be a cardioinhibitory response resulting from either increased parasympathetic activation or vasodepressor response due to inhibition of sympathetic activity, or a mixed response including both. Vasovagal syncope may be caused by autonomic cardioinhibitory and/or vasodilator response. It is likely that sensory inputs through vagal afferents, pain pathways, and central pathways affect the nucleus tractus solitaries to cause sympathoinhibition and vagal efferent activation. These responses are triggered by warm environment, prolonged standing, pain, illness, emotions, venous puncture, standing, fasting, fatigue, drug use, and menstruation. Bezold-Jarisch and carotid sinus reflexes are also thought to be involved. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex, a type of autonomic dysfunction, activates mechanoreceptors in the left ventricle when blood volume is low and stimulates sympathetic tone. Such sympathetic stimulation may result in activation of vagal afferents. The carotid sinus reflex results in increased blood pressure applied to the carotid sinus, which enhances the baroreceptor and activates vagal efferents</offsets><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8450" xml_f="8451" txt_i="3246" txt_f="3247">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8458" xml_f="8459" txt_i="3247" txt_f="3248">,</offsets><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8490" xml_f="8491" txt_i="3248" txt_f="3249">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8498" xml_f="8499" txt_i="3249" txt_f="3250">,</offsets><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8530" xml_f="8532" txt_i="3250" txt_f="3252">5)</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8539" xml_f="8540" txt_i="3252" txt_f="3253">.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8547" xml_f="9335" txt_i="3254" txt_f="4042">In a previous study, vasovagal syncope was defined as sympathetic-parasympathetic imbalance detected by heart rate variability (HRV), head up tilt (HUT) test and 24-hour electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring in adults. However, there were only a few HRV studies regarding vasovagal syncope in children and adolescents, and studies of baseline HRV are even more rare. There is a range of time domains (from less than 30 seconds to 24 hours) to explore cardiac autonomic tone for HRV analysis. In this study, we evaluated baseline HRV of children and adolescents with vasovagal syncope and compared the values with those of healthy controls. We hypothesized that we would detect imbalances of the autonomic nervous system in syncopal patients, and hoped to design more effective preventions.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title><offsets xml_i="9386" xml_f="9407" txt_i="4044" txt_f="4065">Materials and methods</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9427" xml_f="9438" txt_i="4066" txt_f="4077">1.

Although rapid growth in adolescents requires dramatic increases in blood volume, the adolescent cardiovascular system cannot meet this challenge.

However, care should be taken for use in pediatrics because adverse effects associated with fludrocortisones include hypertension, pulmonary edema, hypokalemia, hypomagnecemia.
