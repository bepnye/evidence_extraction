Exclusion criteria typically focus on identifying subjects who might be harmed by the study intervention, those for whom benefit is doubtful and those who are unlikely to provide useful data. Inclusion criteria tend to focus on risk: all trials identify the population at risk for the study event, some trials additionally specify criteria to define a study population at high-risk. For example, a trial comparing recurrence rates between two approaches to prostatectomy will specify only that patients with localized prostate cancer are eligible; a trial to determine the effects of adjuvant therapy might further restrict eligibility to patients with locally advanced cancer who are at high risk of recurrence. In some cases trialists studying a similar question have reached different conclusions as to whether to include the whole at-risk population or only a high-risk subgroup.

The results of the method have a ready clinical interpretation that can immediately aid trial design, moreover, the method is easily adapted to determine which of several competing definitions of high-risk is optimal. In a previous paper, which focused on screening and prevention, two of us argued that the population accrued to a trial should be the same as that to whom the intervention will be applied in practice[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="7070" xml_f="7071" txt_i="3699" txt_f="3700">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7078" xml_f="7493" txt_i="3700" txt_f="4115">]. Thus the decision whether to include all members of an eligible population, or just a high-risk sub-group, should depend on the relative benefit of these alternative strategies were they to be clinically applied after the completion of a trial indicating an effect of the intervention. We therefore model benefits of alternative strategies in a hypothetical population in order to determine the optimal approach.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="7534" xml_f="7540" txt_i="4117" txt_f="4123">Method</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7551" xml_f="8240" txt_i="4124" txt_f="4813">Our method is based on the assumption that interventions proven in randomized trials will be offered to eligible patients similar to those studied in the trial. For example, we assume that if a trial accruing patients with locally advanced prostate cancer demonstrates effectiveness of adjuvant therapy, such treatment will subsequently be offered to patients with locally advanced but not organ-confined disease. We therefore compare the predicted outcome of treating all at-risk patients in the population at large to the outcome of treating only the high-risk subgroup. We then recommend the approach with the better outcome to determine the inclusion criteria for the randomized trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8247" xml_f="9270" txt_i="4814" txt_f="5837">Outcome is defined in terms of "net benefit" in the eligible population. Net benefit is a concept often used in economic analysis and is simply benefits minus harms. In the case of a medical intervention, "benefits" are associated with reduction in the event rate compared to no additional treatment: in an adjuvant therapy trial, for instance, benefit would be a reduction in cancer recurrences or deaths compared to surgery alone. "Harms" are associated with the intervention itself: side-effects, costs, inconvenience and so on. To assess the relative outcome of the whole population and high-risk approach, we therefore need to calculate the proportion of patients who would be treated, and the reduction in event rate, for each approach. For the whole population approach this is straightforward: the proportion of patients treated is 100% and the reduction in event rate is simply the event rate in the absence of intervention multiplied by the anticipated relative risk of the event with versus without intervention.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9277" xml_f="9712" txt_i="5838" txt_f="6273">To determine intervention and event rates for the approach of treating only high-risk patients, consider that an investigator proposing a trial on high-risk patients must propose specific criteria to determine high-risk. This might involve a single risk factor (e.g. non-organ confined disease) or a threshold probability on a multivariable prediction model (or "nomogram") including a variety of risk factors (e.g. stage, grade, PSA [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="9743" xml_f="9744" txt_i="6273" txt_f="6274">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9751" xml_f="10551" txt_i="6274" txt_f="7074">]). Such criteria can be seen as a prediction tool: individuals who meet the criteria are thought to be more likely to experience a disease-related event than those who do not meet the criteria. We can then calculate the sensitivity and specificity of this prediction tool. To define "sensitivity" we use as the numerator the number of individuals in the eligible population who both have the event (in the absence of intervention) and who are classified as high risk; the denominator is the total number of patients who have the event. "Specificity" is comparably defined by using for the numerator the number of individuals in the eligible population who do not have the event and who do not meet the criteria for high risk; the denominator is the total number who do not have the event (see table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="10583" xml_f="10584" txt_i="7074" txt_f="7075">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10591" xml_f="10770" txt_i="7075" txt_f="7254"> for illustrative data).

The formula for the event rate after the intervention is applied to high-risk subjects is: Event rate in the absence of intervention × sensitivity × relative risk + Event rate in the absence of intervention × (1 – sensitivity) or 20% × 47% × 0.75 + 20% × 53% = 17.65%.

We would recommend using this as the eligibility criteria for the trial. One particular advantage of our approach is that net benefit has a simple clinical interpretation in terms of either a decrease in event rate while keeping the intervention rate constant or a decrease in the intervention rate while keeping the event rate constant. For example, the net benefit for the high-risk group is 0.0296 greater than that of not using adjuvant therapy in any patient. Thus the strategy of calculating a prediction for all patients and administering an intervention to those with a predicted risk of recurrence ≥ 10% gives the same net benefit as a strategy (say, a change in surgical technique) that leads to the equivalent of about 3 fewer recurrences per 100 patients without any patients receiving adjuvant therapy. A similar calculation can be conducted to determine the decrease in intervention rate for a constant event rate: in this case, the difference in net benefit is multiplied by the NNT</offsets><sub><offsets xml_i="22150" xml_f="22151" txt_i="16308" txt_f="16309">t</offsets></sub><offsets xml_i="22157" xml_f="22158" txt_i="16309" txt_f="16310">.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22180" xml_f="22200" txt_i="16312" txt_f="16332">Sensitivity analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22211" xml_f="22661" txt_i="16333" txt_f="16783">Any of the inputs required to calculate net benefit can be varied to determine whether this affects which strategy is deemed optimal.

If an intervention is either very effective or highly tolerable, the high-risk approach is only of benefit if selection criteria are highly sensitive, in other words, in the case that nearly all those who could benefit from the intervention receive it. Conversely, if the effectiveness of the intervention is moderate, or it is poorly tolerated, selection criteria must be specific, that is, only those patients who would benefit are selected. These considerations suggest that focusing on a high-risk group might be of particular value for screening or prevention trials, as these typically involve low event rates, interventions of moderate effectiveness and a population with a low tolerance for adverse treatment effects.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label><offsets xml_i="30652" xml_f="30659" txt_i="21562"

To our knowledge, no previous investigators have described a simple strategy for determining whether a trial should accrue patients selected from the whole at-risk population or only to those from a high-risk subgroup.

One important assumption of the method is that the relative risk for intervention versus no intervention is constant over the choice of risk groups. Generally speaking, we do not know whether this is true: indeed, two of us have previously used possible inconstancy of relative risk to argue against accruing only high-risk patients and then applying the results to the whole eligible population[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="42082" xml_f="42083" txt_i="28857" txt_f="28858">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42090" xml_f="42704" txt_i="28858" txt_f="29472">]. However, we think there is an important difference between using a certain assumption to help design a trial and using it to make a clinical decision. In case of a clinical decision about treatment, patients could be harmed if assumptions about relative risk do not hold. We would therefore like to avoid any such assumptions. In the case of trial design, any design we choose necessarily involves assumptions, explicit or otherwise, about the relationship between relative and absolute risk. Moreover, these assumptions can be tested once the trial is completed and further research recommended if appropriate.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42711" xml_f="42798" txt_i="29473" txt_f="29560">An apparent disadvantage of our method is that it involves a subjective judgment of NNT</offsets><sub><offsets xml_i="42803" xml_f="42804" txt_i="29560" txt_f="29561">t</offsets></sub><offsets xml_i="42810" xml_f="42993" txt_i="29561" txt_f="29744">, and a prediction as to relative risk.

However, in practice, clinicians and statisticians are uncomfortable recommending interventions to sub-groups of patients unless these have demonstrated clinical and statistical significance in the primary analysis of a randomized trial. It is quite plausible that an intervention with a modest effect size, or one targeting a moderately prevalent disease, will not show sufficient overall effectiveness in definitive trial and will be dropped from consideration, even though it would be of important benefit to a sub-group of high-risk patients. An illustrative recent example is the Women's Health Initiative study of calcium and vitamin D for fracture prevention. Overall, this study found rather small benefits of supplementation[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="44467" xml_f="44468" txt_i="31132" txt_f="31133">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44475" xml_f="44965" txt_i="31133" txt_f="31623">], the key conclusion being that treatment "did not significantly reduce hip fracture". Many of the women in this study were at very low risk: for example, 37% of the participants were aged 50 to 59 and the rate of fracture in this sub-group was only about 0.3%. It is entirely possible that supplementation is of important benefit for older women at higher risk of fracture, but that the use of supplementation in the community will decline given the rather negative overall study results.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44972" xml_f="46504" txt_i="31624" txt_f="33156">In this paper, we have introduced a statistical method to determine whether or not to restrict a study to a high-risk population and, if so, to determine which of several competing definitions of high-risk is optimal. Our method is simple and produces results with direct clinical applicability. It should appeal to clinicians since the quantitative results are in concert with clinical intuition. However, we feel that the mathematical details of our method are perhaps less important than our overall message, which includes four main points. First, it may be more rational to focus on high-risk groups than to treat everyone at risk. Second, whether or not to restrict an intervention to a high-risk group is a question that can be informed by data and statistical analyses. It is our impression that current decisions about whom to include in trials have not been statistically based, rather, they appear to have depended on informal judgment. Third, trial eligibility criteria in trials that attempt to identify high-risk subjects (such as pack years in a lung cancer screening trial) can be seen as predictions with certain statistical properties. We have chosen to describe these in terms of sensitivity and specificity, on the grounds that these terms are readily understood by most clinicians. Fourth, we can compare different approaches to trial eligibility using formal statistical analysis. We believe that a more systematic approach to patient selection will maximize the benefits of randomized trials for human health.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title><offsets xml_i="46560" xml_f="46582" txt_i="33158" txt_f="33180">Supplementary Material</offsets></title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="S1"><caption><title><offsets xml_i="46664" xml_f="46681" txt_i="33181" txt_f="33198">Additional file 1</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="46692" xml_f="46781" txt_i="33199" txt_f="33288">Appendix.
