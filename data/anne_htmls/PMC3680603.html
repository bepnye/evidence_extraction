Moderate systemic hypothermia (range, 28℃ to 30℃) was used. Patients were weaned from CPB when the rectal temperature reached 35℃.

According to these studies, doses of ulinastatin administered to adult patients were relatively small compared to the others, and assumed to be insufficient to provide a complete anti-inflammatory effect. Likewise, the present study (5,000 U/kg) revealed no significant effect of ulinastatin on cardiac markers, creatinine, or lactate levels, though postoperative levels of cardiac markers and lactate were significantly higher than preoperative ones. These results strongly suggest that we need to consider the increased dose of ulinastatin concentrations to estimate the effect of prevention from major organ failure.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18968" xml_f="19315" txt_i="13294" txt_f="13641">Another previous study reported that ulinastatin attenuated the elevation of IL-8 release after CPB and was closely associated with improved pulmonary variables.

One of the critical limitations of this study was that we could not assess whether the administered dose of ulinastatin suppressed the release of PMNE adequately. Overall, the present study showed that intra-operative application of ulinastatin (5,000 U/kg) did not influence systemic inflammatory and coagulative reactions or multi-organ dysfunctions, especially postoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements. As far as the present study, an insufficient dosage of administered ulinastatin could be considered first, and a continuous infusion of high-dose ulinastatin could be more effective because the plasma half-life of ulinastatin is short, at about 40 minutes [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="21115" xml_f="21117" txt_i="15242" txt_f="15244">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21124" xml_f="21282" txt_i="15244" txt_f="15402">].
