CREST is sponsored by the US National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), with additional support by a device manufacturer, and will provide data to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for evaluation of a stent device. Because of budget constraints for CREST, Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) reimbursement for hospital costs incurred by CREST patients will be essential. The involvement of academic scientists, industry, and three separate government agencies (NIH, FDA, HCFA) has presented many challenges in conducting the trial. A review of the pathways followed to meet these challenges may be helpful to others seeking to facilitate sharing of the costs and burdens of conducting innovative clinical research.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>carotid endarterectomy</kwd><kwd>carotid stent</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>government agencies</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title></title><p><offsets xml_i="4733" xml_f="4907" txt_i="1112" txt_f="1286">CREST is a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial of CEA versus CAS for prevention of stroke in patients with symptomatic stenosis greater than or equal to 50% [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="4938" xml_f="4939" txt_i="1286" txt_f="1287">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="4946" xml_f="5623" txt_i="1287" txt_f="1964">].

In response, the HCFA issued a national noncoverage policy against reimbursement to hospitals for expenses incurred by use of carotid angioplasty in Medicare patients. (Medicare is the US federal government insurance program for people aged 65 years or older, certain young people with disabilities, and people with end-stage renal disease.) This moratorium was issued because of the lack of scientific and clinical evidence regarding the effectiveness of carotid angioplasty. Subsequently, this moratorium against carotid angioplasty was extended to cover carotid stenting as well. Because third party payers use HCFA payment as part of their guidelines for reimbursement, this decision resulted in many payers also declining to reimburse expenses incurred with carotid angioplasty, with or without stenting.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7326" xml_f="7395" txt_i="3476" txt_f="3545">Submission of CREST proposals to the US National Institutes of Health</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7406" xml_f="7703" txt_i="3546" txt_f="3843">In 1996, a group of clinical scientists representing a number of disciplines (neurology, cardiology, interventional radiology, neuroradiology, vascular surgery, neuro-surgery, and biostatistics /epidemiology) began to develop a proposal for comparing the relative efficacies of CEA and CAS (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="7735" xml_f="7736" txt_i="3843" txt_f="3844">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7743" xml_f="8792" txt_i="3844" txt_f="4893">). This original submission was a 'proof of principle' trial, in which stents from a variety of manufacturers would be allowed at the discretion of the interventionist. The aim of the study was to contrast 'best' CEA versus 'best' CAS. In January 1997, as part of the preparation for this original grant application, the CREST Executive Committee had several meetings with the HCFA that resulted in written assurance that a funded NIH grant, coupled with FDA approval, would ensure coverage for the parts of the CREST protocol that dealt with 'carotid angioplasty with stents and related services'. As part of the initial application, representatives of the CREST investigative team also had a series of meetings with the FDA to review a draft protocol and to discuss procedures for the interpretation of results in order to provide 'proof of principle' for CAS in general, and for the broadening of indications for the specific devices produced by manufacturers.

The NINDS program directors for CREST attended all of the FDA and the Guidant Corporation meetings to which they were invited. When subsequent protocol changes were 'suggested' by the FDA, however, the details of these changes had to first be negotiated with the CREST investigators, then with the Guidant Corporation, and then the finalized changes submitted for review by the NINDS and the DSMB. Likewise, when subsequent protocol changes were 'suggested' by the DSMB, the details of these changes had to be negotiated, and then submitted to the FDA for their review. The FDA is required by regulation to complete this review within 30-days of receipt.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18391" xml_f="19090" txt_i="12541" txt_f="13240">Despite efforts to facilitate the communication with electronic mail, the process was made cumbersome by the formal channels of communication from CREST investigators to the NINDS, who then communicated with the DSMB, and from the CREST investigators to the Guidant Corporation, who then communicated with the FDA. The protocol development process was, however, facilitated by joint FDA, NINDS, Guidant Corporation, and CREST investigator meetings. Clearly, in order to co-ordinate research among the NIH, academic investigators, manufacturers, and the FDA, communication is greatly complicated and research may be delayed when the FDA and NINDS peer reviewers do not agree on a single study design.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19097" xml_f="19958" txt_i="13241" txt_f="14102">An additional conflict of responsibilities arose because the FDA required Guidant Corporation (as the holder of the IDE) to be the primary depository of regulatory documents, such as Institutional Review Board approval. However, NINDS requires the office of the Principal Investigator to be the primary depository of these documents. Therefore, obtaining required documentation is a complex organizational feat that requires clear lines of communication and record keeping in order to minimize confusion from staff at the local clinical sites. For example, conflict of interest statements, approved informed consent documents, and Institutional Review Board approval documentation are independently required by the awardee institution for NINDS, and by the Guidant Corporation for the FDA. This duplication creates additional burden in the conduct of the study.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="19980" xml_f="20049" txt_i="14104" txt_f="14173">Obtaining reimbursement from the Health Care Financing Administration</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20060" xml_f="20585" txt_i="14174" txt_f="14699">As noted above, in January 1997, contingent on NIH funding and FDA approval, the HCFA committed in writing to support reimbursement for the stents placed as part of CREST. However, in May 2000, 3.5 years later, the Principal Investigator received verbal notification that the HCFA 'would be unwilling to grant [CREST] an exception to the national noncoverage policy for reimbursement for carotid angioplasty with stenting'.

Although 24 clinical centers had already participated in a CREST investigators' meeting and co-ordinator training session, further initiation activities were placed on hold because of the uncertainty regarding the future of the trial due to the lack of resources to pay for the hospitalization and standard care of patients randomized in CREST.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21047" xml_f="21333" txt_i="15149" txt_f="15435">Over several months, NINDS, the Guidant Corporation, and the FDA met with the HCFA in an attempt to resolve the problem.

Underlying this is an acknowledgment of the importance of a trial that examines carotid stenting. This is shared not only by the CREST investigators and NINDS, but also by the representatives of industry, the FDA, and the HCFA. Through this commitment by all involved, the substantial hurdles have been overcome and the study is now underway.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22746" xml_f="23244" txt_i="16698" txt_f="17196">As of mid-June 2001, 47 centers have been selected to participate in CREST. Eight centers are approved to enroll participants in the lead-in phase, one center is approved to enroll participants in the randomization phase, and the remaining centers are in various stages of completing the regulatory and certification requirements. CREST is in an optimal position to demonstrate whether academic institutions, government agencies, and industry can work together to complete a complex clinical trial.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23266" xml_f="23285" txt_i="17198" txt_f="17217">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23296" xml_f="23310" txt_i="17218" txt_f="17232">None declared.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23332" xml_f="23345" txt_i="17234" txt_f="17247">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23356" xml_f="23752" txt_i="17248" txt_f="17644">CAS = carotid artery stenting; CEA = carotid endarterectomy; CREST = Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial; DSMB = Data and Safety Monitoring Board; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; HCFA = Health Care Financing Administration; IDE = investigational device exemption; NIH = National Institutes of Health; NINDS = National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23774" xml_f="23817" txt_i="17646" txt_f="17689">Appendix: CREST Executive Committee members</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23828" xml_f="25415" txt_i="17690" txt_f="19277">Robert W Hobson, II, MD, CREST Principal Investigator; University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, USA; Tom G Brott, MD, co-Principal Investigator, Neurology; Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, USA; JP Mohr, MD, co-Principal Investigator, Neurology; Columbia University, New York, New York, USA; Robert DG Ferguson, MD, co-Principal Investigator, intervention (radiology); Forsyth Radiology Associates, Forsyth Medical Center, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA; Gary S Roubin, MD, co-Principal Investigator, intervention (cardiology); Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, New York, USA; Wesley C Moore, MD, co-Principal Investigator, surgery; UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA; LN Hopkins, MD, co-Principal Investigator, neurosurgery; State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, New York, USA; George Howard, DrPH, co-Principal Investigator, statistical analysis; University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA; Richard Kuntz, MD, co-Principal Investigator, data management; Harvard Clinical Research Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; DE Strandness, MD, co-Principal Investigator, ultrasound; University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington, USA; Jeff Popma, MD, co-Principal Investigator, angiography; Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; Beverly Huss, co-Principal Investigator, interventional device; Guidant Corporation, Menlo Park, California, USA; John R Marler, MD, co-Principal Investigator, project officer; NIH-NINDS, Rockville, Maryland, USA</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This study is supported by the USPHS NIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) RO1 NS38384 and the Advanced Cardiovascular Systems, Inc.
