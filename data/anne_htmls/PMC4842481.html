stiffness that can be diminished by a program of physical activity. A novel exercise
intervention, whole-body vibration (WBV), is reported to significantly improve arterial
stiffness in healthy men and older sedentary adults. However, little is known about its
efficacy in reducing arterial stiffness in chronic stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Six
participants with chronic stroke were randomly assigned to 4 weeks of WBV training or
control followed by cross-over after a 2-week washout period. WBV intervention consisted
of 3 sessions of 5 min intermittent WBV per week for 4 weeks. Arterial stiffness (carotid
arterial stiffness, pulse wave velocity [PWV], pulse and wave analysis [PWA]) were
measured before/after each intervention. [Results] No significant improvements were
reported with respect to carotid arterial stiffness, PWV, and PWA between WBV and control.
However, carotid arterial stiffness showed a decrease over time following WBV compared to
control, but this was not significant. [Conclusion] Three days/week for 4 weeks of WBV
seems too short to elicit appropriate changes in arterial stiffness in chronic stroke.
However, no adverse effects were reported, indicating that WBV is a safe and acceptable
exercise modality for people with chronic stroke.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Arterial stiffness</kwd><kwd>Pulse wave velocity</kwd><kwd>Augmentation index</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="4824" xml_f="4836" txt_i="1378" txt_f="1390">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4847" xml_f="5108" txt_i="1391" txt_f="1652">Post-stroke survivors face the problem of being predisposed to a sedentary lifestyle that

effects of short-term WBV training on carotid arterial stiffness in chronic stroke
survivors. We hypothesized that 4 weeks of WBV training would significantly reduce arterial

carotid and radial arteries were recorded non-invasively using applanation tonometry as
described above. The recordings were gated using the integrated electrocardiogram, with
the velocity of the pulse wave being calculated using the integrated software (SCOR Px
7.1, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia). Participants remained in the supine position for
BP measurements that were obtained prior to PWV measurements. Prior to electrode
placement, any excess hair was removed with a razor and the area cleaned with alcohol
wipes. Surface pre-gelled Ag-AgCl electrodes (Ambu, Ballerup, Denmark) were placed on the
participant’s chest: 1 cm below the suprasternal notch on the sternum, 1 cm above the
xiphoid process on the sternum, and 3 cm above the left iliac crest. Distal and proximal
measurements were then measured and recorded for each participant. The measurements of PWV
and carotid-to-radial pulse transit time standard deviation (PTT SD) were used for
subsequent analysis.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24321" xml_f="24668" txt_i="14253" txt_f="14600">The common carotid artery was imaged non-invasively using commercial B-mode ultrasound

Blood pressure of the common carotid
artery was recorded using applanation tonometry as described above. Blood pressure at the
brachial artery, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse
pressure (PP) were sampled from four 6-second video recordings. For each participant, the
probe was placed on the common carotid artery opposite to that of the stroke-affected side
at a perpendicular (90°) angle to the vessel, 1 to 2 cm below bifurcation. Ultrasound
global and probe-dependent settings were all standardized. Participants held their breath
during each of the four 6-second video recordings with the common carotid artery diameters
extending across the entire imaging plane. The four 6-second diameter measurements of
systolic diameter (Dsys), diastolic diameter (Ddia), and the difference between systolic
diameter and diastolic diameter (Dist) were collected and averaged. Additionally,
distensibility coefficient (DC) and compliance coefficient (CC) measurements were obtained
via ultrasound; where DC is the relative rise of arterial cross-sectional area for a given
increase in pressure, and CC is the absolute rise in cross-sectional area for a given
increase in arterial pressure, and assumes that the length of the vessel is unaltered by
the pulse wave.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26024" xml_f="26429" txt_i="15900" txt_f="16302">A repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine differences
