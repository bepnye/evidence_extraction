There was a positive and direct correlation between time to treatment and these baseline characteristics. As the number of ODs increased, or patients were receiving mechanical ventilation or vasopressors, or had recent surgery (probably a result of protocol instruction to commence or resume DrotAA infusion only 12 hours or more after surgery), the time to treatment increased. In contrast, patients with higher APACHE II scores (defined by quartiles) were treated significantly earlier after their first documented sepsis-induced OD. For APACHE II scores there was an inverse relationship between time to treatment and this baseline characteristic. As APACHE II scores increased, the time to treatment decreased.

Deaths from sepsis-induced multiorgan dysfunction (MOD) were most common, whether they occurred early or late (days 1 to 14 and days 15 to 28).

This suggests that therapy with DrotAA in patients with severe sepsis is beneficial, even after OD has been present for more than 24 hours. Data were sparse for treatment times of more than 36 hours after sepsis-induced OD, and therefore caution must be used in making conclusions about the benefit of DrotAA at later times. However, there seemed to be a trend toward improved outcomes among patients treated earlier with DrotAA. Such a trend was not observed among the comparative placebo patients.

For example, in the PROWESS study [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="25545" xml_f="25546" txt_i="19615" txt_f="19616">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25553" xml_f="25938" txt_i="19616" txt_f="20001">], the average time from initial OD to infusion of study drug was 17.5 hours. Only 11% of PROWESS patients began DrotAA infusion more than 24 hours after OD, which limits the power of an analysis with only the subjects from this trial.

In addition, a second propensity score was used to adjust for covariates associated with the time to treatment. Ultimately, there was a persistent independent association between earlier treatment with DrotAA and outcome. With the adjusted model (adjusted for covariates and propensity scores), logistic regression analysis suggested that treatment within 24 hours of OD with DrotAA was associated with 23% lower odds of death at 28 days, compared with treatment more than 24 hours after sepsis-induced OD. Also in the adjusted model, Cox regression survival analysis suggested that earlier treatment was associated with a 19% lower adjusted hazard of death for the first 28 days of follow-up.

The lack of placebo patients might be of particular importance at later times, where even less information was available. However, we were encouraged by the similarities in baseline measures among the subjects in the various studies. In addition, the mortality rate among placebo patients was very similar across the studies. These similarities were reassuring and suggest that the study cohort was relatively homogeneous.

This could bias the results toward a benefit for earlier treatment. Additionally, those patients treated within the first 24 hours might have had care providers more attentive to the signs of sepsis and potentially more attentive care overall.

The need for mechanical ventilation or vasopressors, additional baseline ODs, and recent surgery were independently associated with a longer time to treatment with DrotAA. This might reflect the fact that initial efforts to stabilize a patient (such as appropriate antibiotic therapy or fluid resuscitation) were performed before the use of DrotAA was initiated. It might also reflect the use of APACHE II scores to direct therapy (see below). Although not confirmed by prospective studies, the potential importance of the timing of drug administration observed here suggests that efforts to incorporate the use of DrotAA into early treatment protocols for severe sepsis might serve to hasten treatment and improve outcome.

The separation in survival curves between those treated with DrotAA and those receiving placebo occurred much earlier. This suggests that the benefit of DrotAA over placebo is apparent early. However, earlier versus later DrotAA therapy has an additional effect that was not observed until 14 days after DrotAA treatment was started. An explanation for this observation may reside in differences in the causes of death in severe sepsis. Sepsis-induced MOD was the most common cause of death throughout the 28 days of follow-up (see Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"><offsets xml_i="31693" xml_f="31694" txt_i="25452" txt_f="25453">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31701" xml_f="32333" txt_i="25453" txt_f="26085">). However, earlier treatment (within 24 hours of OD) with DrotAA seemed to attenuate the number of deaths due to sepsis-induced MOD, during days 15 to 28. This difference accounted for a majority of the difference in overall mortality seen between the group receiving earlier DrotAA treatment and the group receiving this therapy later. The comparative placebo group did not have a similar association. It is possible that early treatment with DrotAA (within 24 hours of OD) does not change the course of septic shock or respiratory failure in isolation but has a more pronounced effect on the resolution of ODs in the form of MOD.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32340" xml_f="33111" txt_i="26086" txt_f="26857">This study suggests that treatment with DrotAA within 24 hours may carry a larger survival advantage for patients with severe sepsis, compared with those treated more than 24 hours after OD. However, later treatment with DrotAA was also associated with lower mortality when compared with patients receiving placebo. Because of the burden of disease and the expected increase in the number of cases of severe sepsis, there is an emphasis on improving the early identification of severe sepsis. Recent studies showing promise in affecting the outcome of patients with severe sepsis involve early intervention.

The finding in the present study that earlier administration of DrotAA to appropriate patients may have greater benefit than later therapy fits into this paradigm.

The percentage 28-day survivals are shown parenthetically in the key. Kaplan-Meier survival curves are displayed for therapy groups (namely DrotAA and placebo), as well as for time-to-treatment groups (namely 0 to 24 hours and more than 24 hours). Both DrotAA time-to-treatment curves were significantly different from the placebo time-to-treatment curves. At 14 days, the DrotAA earlier treatment curve (0 to 24 hours) started to diverge from the later treatment curve (more than 24 hours).

With the use of logistic (odds ratios for DrotAA versus placebo) and Cox (hazard ratios for DrotAA versus placebo) regression analyses, modeling of the treatment effect as a function of time to treatment was performed. In both analyses there was a trend (logistic regression, <italic>p </italic>= 0.06; Cox regression, <italic>p </italic>= 0.07) toward a more beneficial effect with earlier administration of DrotAA (solid line, ratios less than 1 until 36 hours). The most precise estimates of the model were between 12 and 24 hours, as indicated by the narrowest 95% confidence intervals (dashed lines). Outside this range, estimates of benefit were much less precise (that is, wider 95% confidence intervals furthest from the solid line).
