In addition, lower number of reinjections needed in Group I means that intravitreal ranibizumab treatment is effective in preventing recurrence in patients with stage I RAP. Stage II and stage III lesions seem to be more difficult to treat, because theses lesions have PED or chorioretinal anastomoses. This may be one of the reasons why RAP is known to have a poorer prognosis than neovascular AMD. In the PrONTO study [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26"><offsets xml_i="23854" xml_f="23856" txt_i="16721" txt_f="16723">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23863" xml_f="24530" txt_i="16723" txt_f="17390">], RAP lesions received 5.8 injections per year, and the number of ranibizumab injections showed a higher frequency than other types of AMD. In comparison, the mean number of injections (4.07) in our study seems to be lower than that of the PrONTO study. But, except for stage I, RAP at stages II and III received 4.88 injections, which was a similar number to the one in the PrONTO study, although a direct comparison is not possible. Especially, patients in stage I RAP presented relatively few recurrences and responded well compared with patients in stages II and III. Therefore, these results showed that the stage of RAP could be an important prognostic factor.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24537" xml_f="24619" txt_i="17391" txt_f="17473">With regard to the combination of an anti-VEGF agent with PDT for RAP, Lee et al [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32"><offsets xml_i="24652" xml_f="24654" txt_i="17473" txt_f="17475">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24661" xml_f="25409" txt_i="17475" txt_f="18223">] reported an improvement in the mean visual acuity from 20/125 at the baseline to 20/63 at the 12-month follow-up of 9 eyes treated with ranibizumab in conjunction with PDT in stages II and III. But the fact that geographic atrophy was detected in the groups having combined PDT with an anti-VEGF agent suggests that simultaneous combination treatment with PDT in patients with RAP may enhance photochemical stress in the normal choroid with prolonged or magnified hypofluorescence in ICGA because of ischemia in the normal choriocapillaries. Sometimes photodynamic therapy can lead to significant adverse effects such as massive hemorrhage, RPE damage and fibrous scar formation; such complications are a serious concern and cannot be overlooked.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25416" xml_f="25430" txt_i="18224" txt_f="18238">Rouvas et al [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33"><offsets xml_i="25463" xml_f="25465" txt_i="18238" txt_f="18240">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25472" xml_f="26339" txt_i="18240" txt_f="19107">] reported that lesions that are believed to be Stage II may in reality be Stage III because of the presence of small undetectable chorioretinal anastomoses. We should understand the difference in prognosis according to the stage of the disease. In the present study, it is possible to say that because the mean number of injections was lower in stage I, patients in this group experienced a lower rate of complications and recurrences in comparison with patients in other stages. These findings have important implications in the prognosis of RAP in that the early diagnosis of stage I RAP is critical in preventing recurrence of RAP. Although no eye in the three subgroups showed progression to a higher stage of RAP during the follow-up, additional therapies such as more frequent ranibizumab injection and combined with PDT can be considered in stages II and III.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title><offsets xml_i="26393" xml_f="26404" txt_i="19109" txt_f="19120">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26415" xml_f="27056" txt_i="19121" txt_f="19762">Although our study has some limitations such as the retrospective nature of the study, the absence of a control group, a small number of patients, and a relatively short follow-up time, our results suggest that ranibizumab monotherapy may be a safe and highly effective treatment option for patients with RAP lesions that are in early stage. On the other hand, selective individuals in late stage are required more additional therapies. A larger, controlled, prospective, randomized comparative study with a longer follow-up period will be required to fully compare differences in treatment efficacy according to the clinical staging of RAP.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AMD</term><def><p>age-related macular degeneration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BCVA</term><def><p>best-corrected Snellen visual acuity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMT</term><def><p>central macular thickness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CNV</term><def><p>choroidal neovascularization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FA</term><def><p>fluorescein angiography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICGA</term><def><p>indocyanine green angiography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRN</term><def><p>intraretinal neovascularization</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OCT</term><def><p>optical coherence tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PDT</term><def><p>photodynamic therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PED</term><def><p>pigment epithelium detachment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAP</term><def><p>retinal angiomatous proliferation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SRN</term><def><p>subretinal neovascularization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors’ contributions</bold></p><p>Literature screening and selection was performed by YJR.
