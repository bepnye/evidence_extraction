Xylose is a sucrase inhibitor suggested to suppress the postprandial glucose surge. The objectives of this study were to assess the inhibitory effects of two different concentrations of xylose on postprandial glucose and insulin responses and to evaluate its efficacy in the presence of other macronutrients. Randomized double-blind cross-over studies were conducted to examine the effect of D-xylose on postprandial glucose and insulin response following the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In study 1, the overnight-fasted study subjects (n = 49) consumed a test sucrose solution (50 g sucrose in 130 ml water) containing 0, 5, or 7.5 g D-xylose powder. In study 2, the overnight-fasted study subjects (n = 50) consumed a test meal (50 g sucrose in a 60 g muffin and 200 ml sucrose-containing solution). The control meal provided 64.5 g of carbohydrates, 4.5 g of fat, and 10 g of protein. The xylose meal was identical to the control meal except 5 g of xylose was added to the muffin mix. In study 1, the 5 g xylose-containing solutions exhibited significantly lower area under the glucose curve (AUCg) and area under the insulin curve (AUCi) values for 0-15 min (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5059" xml_f="5060" txt_i="1310" txt_f="1311">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5069" xml_f="5083" txt_i="1311" txt_f="1322"> &lt; 0.0001, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5091" xml_f="5092" txt_i="1322" txt_f="1323">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5101" xml_f="5126" txt_i="1323" txt_f="1345"> &lt; 0.0001), 0-30 min (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5134" xml_f="5135" txt_i="1345" txt_f="1346">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5144" xml_f="5158" txt_i="1346" txt_f="1357"> &lt; 0.0001, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5166" xml_f="5167" txt_i="1357" txt_f="1358">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5176" xml_f="5201" txt_i="1358" txt_f="1380"> &lt; 0.0001), 0-45 min (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5209" xml_f="5210" txt_i="1380" txt_f="1381">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5219" xml_f="5233" txt_i="1381" txt_f="1392"> &lt; 0.0001, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5241" xml_f="5242" txt_i="1392" txt_f="1393">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5251" xml_f="5276" txt_i="1393" txt_f="1415"> &lt; 0.0001), 0-60 min (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5284" xml_f="5285" txt_i="1415" txt_f="1416">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5294" xml_f="5308" txt_i="1416" txt_f="1427"> &lt; 0.0001, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5316" xml_f="5317" txt_i="1427" txt_f="1428">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5326" xml_f="5351" txt_i="1428" txt_f="1450"> &lt; 0.0001), 0-90 min (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5359" xml_f="5360" txt_i="1450" txt_f="1451">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5369" xml_f="5383" txt_i="1451" txt_f="1462"> &lt; 0.0001, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5391" xml_f="5392" txt_i="1462" txt_f="1463">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5401" xml_f="5430" txt_i="1463" txt_f="1489"> &lt; 0.0001) and 0-120 min (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5438" xml_f="5439" txt_i="1489" txt_f="1490">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5448" xml_f="5459" txt_i="1490" txt_f="1501"> = 0.0071, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5467" xml_f="5468" txt_i="1501" txt_f="1502">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5477" xml_f="5580" txt_i="1502" txt_f="1605"> = 0.0016).

An earlier study indicated that 80% inhibition of sucrase activity is required to reduce the glycemic response by 50% following treatment with castanosperminem, an established strong sucrase inhibitor, suggesting the sucrase inhibition activity may partly explain the reduction in the glucose response. However, no adaptive response to sucrose digestion was observed after a long-term (14 days) treatment, indicating that sucrase blockers may be safely used as functional substances for glucose homeostatic control. The present study showed no dose-response inhibitory activity, suggesting that there may be an optimal dose to inhibit enzyme activity.

These results suggest that xylose supplemented in a meal with high fat or protein may not exert an identical effect as when supplemented in a sucrose solution. The results showed that a xylose-supplemented meal effectively reduced postprandial serum glucose and insulin responses; however, the extent of suppression was smaller than that of a xylose-supplemented solution. Xylose supplementation maintained its inhibitory activity up to 60 min for both AUCg and AUCi, and the increases in AUCg and AUCi at 0-120 min were reduced by 6.7% and 15.2 %, respectively.

A shortened effectiveness may be explained by the presence of a higher amount of carbohydrate in test meals in study 2 compared to that in study 1 (65 g vs. 50 g) and/or the presence of starch in the test muffin, which may have less opportunity to counteract the sucrase inhibitor in a given time.

L-arabinose is effective for reducing postprandial blood glucose only after a sucrose challenge, but not with a rice starch challenge, whereas bean extract and hibiscus extract were more effective for reducing postprandial blood glucose after a rice starch challenge indicating that each substance may have different specificity to different carbohydrate digestive enzymes. We used a high-fat containing muffin as a test meal as opposed to a sucrose solution to observe possible changes in blood glucose responses due to high-fat content. Because we did not observe a significant difference except a loss of difference in AUCg and AUCi at one time interval (0-120 min), it was assumed that there was not a great deal of interaction between macronutrients and xylose.
