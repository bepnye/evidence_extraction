Recruiter differences did not seem to affect recruitment. Interestingly, the internet database was more efficient than a paper-based database (with shorter time required for data collection and more patients being exposed to the trial). In addition, monetary incentives increased recruitment although the difference was not statistically significant and there is a risk of adverse effect.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="18867" xml_f="18869" txt_i="13511" txt_f="13513">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18876" xml_f="18877" txt_i="13513" txt_f="13514">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="18909" xml_f="18911" txt_i="13514" txt_f="13516">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18918" xml_f="19319" txt_i="13516" txt_f="13917"> Conversely, subjects were recruited without provision of any financial gain in this study except treatment expenses for implant placement and attachment connection.

They also predicted that interactive internet-based strategy will be useful method to provide information. However, this literature was based on evidence in the medical field and may not be directly applicable to dental field. As in this study, enrollment rate of participants at the education sessions such as denture class was not high on the contrary to our expectation. This was because most subjects were senior citizens; younger caregivers were more likely exposed to details of the clinical trial process or educational materials; and patients were already aware of the target disease of edentulism by experience rather than learning by educational sessions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20263" xml_f="20275" txt_i="14810" txt_f="14822">Bader et al.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><offsets xml_i="20307" xml_f="20309" txt_i="14822" txt_f="14824">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20316" xml_f="21123" txt_i="14824" txt_f="15631"> reported their personal experience of carrying out clinical trials by setting up diverse strategies for recruitment. We expected that most subjects could be recruited from the patients at our hospital at the early stages of the study. However, recruitment of participants did not proceed smoothly and various recruitment strategies were employed. We conducted denture educational sessions to educate and recruit potential participants in the community. Participants were also recruited by referral from affiliated hospital or clinics. Among the various approaches, enrollment rate was highest in patients of our hospital and referral patients from community hospitals and clinics. This shows that decision and recommendation of dentists with professional knowledge played a key role in recruitment success.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21130" xml_f="21841" txt_i="15632" txt_f="16343">The most common reasons for withdrawal from the trial were presence of remaining teeth and lack of motivation. Patients with remaining teeth either did not thoroughly understand the details of the trials or do not wish to extract remaining teeth. Insufficient motivation was due to misunderstanding that no surgery was involved in the trial, fear against surgery, and uneasiness for multiple visits to finish the treatment. These factors seemed to be barriers for elderly participants as mentioned before. Education and instruction by sufficiently trained professionals will improve enrollment of participants to increase patients' understanding on the clinical trial process and reduce fears against treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21848" xml_f="22571" txt_i="16344" txt_f="17067">Expenses for fabricating new denture occupied large proportion of the reason of withdrawal (15/126). Other minor reasons of withdrawal include excessive resorption of the mandible and systemic disease. Considering the older age of participants in this study, several patients' general health suddenly deteriorated after enrollment. One participant concealed his general health condition and was discharged from the trial after the health condition was discovered. Although enrollment would have been increased if financial incentives had been provided during the clinical trial, it will require an enormous amount of money. It is the researcher's task to achieve excellent outcomes from clinical trials with limited budget.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="22616" xml_f="22626" txt_i="17069" txt_f="17079">CONCLUSION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22637" xml_f="22973" txt_i="17080" txt_f="17416">To facilitate recruitment of clinical trial subjects and improve enrollment rate, it is important to obtain a sufficient number of researchers, perform promotion activity with diverse strategies, cooperate with local dentists, increase the research funding, and alleviate subjects' fear against clinical trials by thorough consultation.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This study was granted by the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (grant number A110669).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Walton</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name><name><surname>MacEntee</surname><given-names>MI</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Screening and enrolling subjects in a randomized clinical trial involving implant dentures</article-title><source>Int J Prosthodont</source><year>2008</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>210</fpage><lpage>214</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18548957</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Walton</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name><name><surname>MacEntee</surname><given-names>MI</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Choosing or refusing oral implants: a prospective study of edentulous volunteers for a clinical trial</article-title><source>Int J Prosthodont</source><year>2005</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>483</fpage><lpage>488</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16335167</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Osterberg</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Carlsson</surname><given-names>GE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dental state, prosthodontic treatment and chewing ability - a study of five cohorts of 70-year-old subjects</article-title><source>J Oral Rehabil</source><year>2007</year><volume>34</volume><fpage>553</fpage><lpage>559</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17650164</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Feine</surname><given-names>JS</given-names></name><name><surname>Carlsson</surname><given-names>GE</given-names></name><name><surname>Awad</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Chehade</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Duncan</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Gizani</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Head</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Heydecke</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Lund</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>MacEntee</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mericske-Stern</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Mojon</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Morais</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Naert</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Payne</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name><name><surname>Penrod</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Stoker</surname><given-names>GT</given-names></name><name><surname>Tawse-Smith</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>TD</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomason</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomson</surname><given-names>WM</given-names></name><name><surname>Wismeijer</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The McGill consensus statement on overdentures.
