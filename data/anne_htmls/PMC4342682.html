Many such decisions involve complex information, and decision aids that independently use deliberative (analytical and slower) or intuitive (more affective and automatic) cognitive processes for such decisions result in suboptimal decisions. Unconscious thought can arguably use both intuitive and deliberative (slow and analytic) processes, and this combination may further benefit complex patient (or practitioner) decisions as medical decision aids. Indeed, mounting research demonstrates that individuals render better decisions generally if they are distracted from thinking consciously about complex information after it is presented (but can think unconsciously), relative to thinking about that information consciously or not at all.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title><offsets xml_i="6095" xml_f="6104" txt_i="928" txt_f="937">Objective</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6115" xml_f="6521" txt_i="938" txt_f="1344">The current research tested whether the benefits of unconscious thought processes can be replicated using an Internet platform for a patient medical decision involving complex information.

Finally, participants reported their choice of, and attitudes toward, the treatments while experiencing high, low, or no cognitive load, which varied their ability to think consciously while reporting judgments. Cognitive load was manipulated by having participants memorize semi-random (high), line structured (low), or no dot patterns and recall these intermittently with their decision reports.

Complicating this, however, these individuals must commonly consider very complex information to make medical decisions. Thus, growing research has investigated decision aids that might benefit patients and health-care providers as they consider complex medical information [</offsets><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9599" xml_f="9600" txt_i="3873" txt_f="3874">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9607" xml_f="10133" txt_i="3874" txt_f="4400">]. Decision aids are generally used to engage both patients and practitioners in the decision process, and allow patients to understand the potential risks and benefits of a given medical choice. Additionally, decision aids often incorporate value clarification exercises to help patients consider the personal values they place on potential risks and benefits. For example, patients may go through a list of values, select the five most important ones, and bear those in mind while making a medical decision. De Vries et al [</offsets><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10166" xml_f="10167" txt_i="4400" txt_f="4401">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10174" xml_f="10942" txt_i="4401" txt_f="5169">] suggest that decision aids can make use of deliberative processes (requiring intentional and analytical thinking) or intuitive processes (which are more affective, unconscious, or automatic) to consider decision-relevant information. Although decision aids that make use of deliberative processes are more common, both types of processes have strengths and weaknesses for medical decisions. Regarding this, De Vries et al warn that decision aid developers “should be aware that the current common practice to encourage patients to extensively analyze available choice options, typically immediately after information exposure, lacks solid theoretical and empirical grounding…and may even have some harmful side effects to preference construction processes” (p. 159 [</offsets><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10975" xml_f="10976" txt_i="5169" txt_f="5170">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10983" xml_f="11089" txt_i="5170" txt_f="5276">]) and suggest that optimal decision aids would take advantage of the complementarity of the two systems [</offsets><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="11122" xml_f="11123" txt_i="5276" txt_f="5277">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11130" xml_f="11252" txt_i="5277" txt_f="5399">].

They suggest that unconscious thinking processes make use of vast mental resources, whereas conscious thinking processes rely on limited resources such as working and short-term memory.

In this paradigm, individuals receive much information about 3-4 targets (eg, roommates). Further, one target is associated with mostly positive attributes, one with mostly negative attributes, and the other(s) with a balance of positive and negative attributes. Next, participants report their decisions regarding, or preferences for, targets either immediately (allowing for minimal conscious or unconscious thinking), after 3 minutes in which they think about the presented information (ie, think consciously), or after 3 minutes in which they engage in an unrelated task that distracts them from thinking consciously about the presented information (but can still think unconsciously). Typical results demonstrate an “Unconscious Thought Effect” (UTE) such that participants in the “unconscious thought” condition arrive at better decisions (prefer the best over the worst target) relative to participants in the immediate-decision condition. As well, participants in conscious-thought conditions often arrive at decisions comparable to those in the immediate-decision conditions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="13760" xml_f="13813" txt_i="7534" txt_f="7587">Since Dijkterhuis’s first article reporting the UTE [</offsets><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="13846" xml_f="13847" txt_i="7587" txt_f="7588">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="13854" xml_f="14017" txt_i="7588" txt_f="7751">], much research has either replicated the effect or called the effect into question.

In fact, an experiment by DeVries and colleagues investigated the UTE in a health context, and demonstrated that in-training clinical-psychologists (graduate students) achieve more accurate psychiatric diagnoses following a period of unconscious versus conscious thinking. However, the present research sought to investigate the potential benefit of unconscious thinking as a decision aid for the broad population of patients (and is the first to our knowledge to do so), without specific health or medical training. This is noteworthy because experts within a given decision domain (eg, training clinicians) demonstrate the UTE more than non-experts [</offsets><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="16577" xml_f="16579" txt_i="9985" txt_f="9987">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16586" xml_f="17596" txt_i="9987" txt_f="10997">] (eg, patients and the lay-public generally). Thus, demonstrating this effect on medically related decisions—relative to a “non-thinking” control group—even among a general sample could reveal that unconscious thought is a useful decision aid for making complex medical decisions that affect patient health and well-being. Further, the reported research addresses a potential methodological criticism of past unconscious-thought research: participants could theoretically think consciously while reporting their decisions (ie, during the decision phase of the experiment), even following a period of distraction. If true, the UTE might actually result from conscious thinking processes. We explore this possibility by manipulating the amount of cognitive load participants experience during the decision phase of the experiment. This is a relevant and ecologically valid manipulation given the cognitively demanding context of many medical environments, and is novel within the unconscious-thought literature.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17618" xml_f="17667" txt_i="10999" txt_f="11048">Current Aims, Experiment Overview, and Hypotheses</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17678" xml_f="18886" txt_i="11049" txt_f="12257">The aim of the current research was to test whether patient-centered decisions regarding complex treatment options are better following a period of unconscious thought relative to immediate decisions, indicating unconscious thought can be a beneficial decision aid.

Next, all participants received side-effect/attribute information for four potential treatments, one of which was the best, one the worst, and two of which were in the middle. Following this, participants were randomly assigned to a thought condition in which they completed a distraction task for 3 minutes (unconscious), deliberated for 3 minutes (conscious), or were given no time (immediate decision), before reporting their judgments about the treatments. Finally, participants rendered their judgments while under a high, low, or no cognitive load. Thus, overall, participants were randomly assigned to the conditions of a 3 (thought condition) by 3 (cognitive-load level) between-subjects design.

We chose side-effects/attributes with moderate pre-test ratings on both valence and importance dimensions to ensure that one or a few side-effects/attributes would not dominate choices, thereby oversimplifying the decision process. Using these pre-test data, we then assessed the actual quality of each treatment that was used in the main experiment by weighting the valance of treatment side-effects/attributes by importance. This follows logically from research conducted by Bos and colleagues [</offsets><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="23582" xml_f="23583" txt_i="16699" txt_f="16700">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23590" xml_f="24730" txt_i="16700" txt_f="17840">], which demonstrates that unconscious thought makes use of valance and importance information in a logical way (approximately weighting valance by importance) to make sound decisions. For example, a highly positive side-effect/attribute of low importance can affect decisions less than a mildly positive side-effect/attribute of high importance. Thus, for each treatment, we first multiplied the valance rating by the importance rating for each positive side-effect/attribute, then summed these products. We did this again for each negative side-effect/attribute, independently for each treatment. Next, for each treatment, we subtracted the resulting sum for the negative side-effects/attributes from the sum for the positive side-effects/attributes. This created a “quality rating” for each treatment (more positive numbers indicate higher quality), which was analyzed using contrasts within a repeated-measure ANOVA (analysis of variance). These contrasts confirmed that the best treatment was viewed as having better quality (mean 297.75, SD 139.32) than the two balanced treatments (mean 128.92, SD 110.67 and mean 137.48, SD 117.76; </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="24738" xml_f="24739" txt_i="17840" txt_f="17841">F</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="24748" xml_f="24749" txt_i="17841" txt_f="17842">

To our knowledge, this is the first replication of the UTE using a patient-oriented medically related decision task. Further, no such advantage was observed for participants who consciously thought about the information for 3 minutes after receiving treatment information. These trends were mirrored in participants’ attitudes toward the best versus worst treatment, although not significantly. In the field, however, the choices patients and health practitioners make are more consequential to health outcomes than their attitudes toward various treatments. The choice results are strongly in line with a growing body of evidence demonstrating that individuals are more likely to make the best decisions when they think unconsciously, provided the decision task is complex, they are motivated to be accurate, and the task has ecological validity. These conditions were met in the current research: the task was complex and most participants chose an incorrect treatment, participants were motivated to choose the correct treatment (with a US $1 incentive), and the task was constructed to represent a real-life medical decision (albeit, with fictitious treatment information and a fictitious medical condition). Further, these conditions are clearly met in many medical contexts, as treatment information is often complex and all parties involved are motivated to arrive at correct treatment choice. Thus, unconscious thinking processes may greatly aid decision making within many medical contexts.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43463" xml_f="44569" txt_i="32070" txt_f="33176">The present research also explored the possibility that UTEs are not actually the result of unconscious thinking that occurs while people are distracted, but of conscious processes that occur while people solidify and report a judgment. And, to our knowledge, this is the first experiment to investigate this potential alternative account for the UTE. To test this possibility, we varied the cognitive load participants experienced while they reported their choice and attitude judgments, and this manipulation was successful. If the UTE actually results from conscious thinking at the time of judgment, then participants in the unconscious-thought conditions should do worse if they experience high load (compared to low or no load) while reporting their judgments. However, the cognitive-load manipulation had no effect on either of the dependent measures, nor did it interact with thought condition. This overall null effect of cognitive load suggests the UTE does not result from conscious processing at the time of judgment, and judgments are accessed with negligible effort during the decision phase.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44591" xml_f="44624" txt_i="33178" txt_f="33211">Limitations and Future Directions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44635" xml_f="45226" txt_i="33212" txt_f="33803">The reported results indicate that unconscious thought may serve as a beneficial decision aid for patients facing complex medical decisions.

Related, the stimuli used in this experiment were fictitious, although designed to appear medically relevant. Future research should employ real information as the basis of decisions and focus on adapting the unconscious thought paradigm to real-life examples such as the trade-offs between length and quality of life faced by older or terminally ill populations or the time-sensitive medical decisions that one may face in an emergency room. Furthermore, the side-effect/attribute information was presented randomly rather than organized by treatment as would normally happen. This was important to create the decision difficulty needed to verify the results stemmed from unconscious, and not conscious, processes in this initial investigation. However, given the present results, future research could further test the benefit of unconscious thought as a decision aid under more realistic informational settings. Finally, we tested our predictions using a geographically dispersed Web-based sample, not with participants in a controlled environment, and cannot ensure strict instruction compliance. An exact laboratory replication could easily address this limitation. At the same time, however, the present results demonstrate the UTE for medical decisions using a Web-based sample, and suggest that a Web-based platform could be used to create decision aids that foster unconscious thinking.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46672" xml_f="47079" txt_i="35203" txt_f="35610">Ultimately, it will be critical to demonstrate the UTE in actual medical contexts with participants facing real decisions for themselves or others.

First, the cognitive load manipulation used in the present experiment was comprised of visuospatial dot patterns whereas the decision task was primarily verbal. To the extent that visuospatial and verbal processing may employ different cognitive resources, it is possible that the present cognitive load manipulation did not interfere with the decision task enough to adequately test our hypotheses. Although visuospatial stimuli were preferred in the present study to help ensure instruction compliance (reporting random dot patterns requires memory processes because they are difficult to reproduce or write down), future studies should make use of verbal cognitive-load manipulations to address this issue. Additionally, participants were instructed to memorize dot patterns and report their judgments intermittently, but were not instructed to focus primarily on one task or the other. As such, participants had the opportunity to neglect the cognitive task so as to minimize its impact on their performance on the decision task. This eventuality may account for the difference in mean recall observed between the high and low cognitive-load conditions (of note, however, this difference replicates Heyman et al, who interpreted these differences as indicating greater task difficulty rather than decreased task compliance). Future studies could address this issue by specifically stating the primary and secondary task in the instructions. Finally, a baseline assessment of performance on the cognitive load task could also be implemented to assess the extent to which it is affected by the decision task. As ours is the first experiment to explore the influence of cognitive load during the decision phase on UTEs, we strongly encourage future research to address these issues to better couch our current findings.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49063" xml_f="49090" txt_i="37568" txt_f="37595">Conclusion and Implications</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="49101" xml_f="49598" txt_i="37596" txt_f="38093">Patients and health practitioners alike commonly consider a vast amount of information to reach optimal medical decisions. Unfortunately, considerable evidence now indicates that conscious processes can be ill-equipped to integrate complex information, at least without aids (eg, notes, computers, etc). Quite simply, people cannot consciously retain and process vast amounts of information, and thus often form poor decisions via conscious processes. But, according to Dijksterhuis and Nordgren [</offsets><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="49631" xml_f="49632" txt_i="38093" txt_f="38094">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49639" xml_f="50005" txt_i="38094" txt_f="38460">], unconscious thinking can process vast amounts of information with just a little time (eg, 3 minutes), and thus somewhat counterintuitively, individuals often come to better decisions when they are distracted from consciously considering decision-relevant information. The current research demonstrates this can also be true for patient-centered medical decisions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="50012" xml_f="51311" txt_i="38461" txt_f="39760">A hypothetical (and relatively long-term) implication of the current research lies in the type of media used to test the UTE. Unconscious thought research readily utilizes computer and research software platforms, and a Web-based platform was used presently. Demonstrating the UTE in this fashion may constitute evidence that unconscious-thinking decision aids and value clarification exercises may be integrated with Web and mobile technologies within health care realms (given that current limitations are addressed of course). For example, a Web or mobile phone app may in some instances present the relevant information to a medical decision maker, provide a timed and cognitively consuming distraction, then solicit a decision. That is, it is conceivable that a Web or mobile app could model the stages used in the current research for real medical-decision tasks in a way that fosters unconscious thought, and thus better decisions. Further, the merits of unconscious thought should not be limited to treatment side-effects/attributes. Personal values could (theoretically) also be processed unconsciously. This implication is particularly relevant because unconscious thought can process decisional factors that are difficult to articulate or too numerous to maintain in conscious awareness [</offsets><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="51344" xml_f="51345" txt_i="39760" txt_f="39761">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="51352" xml_f="51353" txt_i="39761" txt_f="39762">-</offsets><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="51386" xml_f="51387" txt_i="39762" txt_f="39763">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="51394" xml_f="51588" txt_i="39763" txt_f="39957">]. Patients may therefore be able to use an “unconscious thought mobile app” as a beneficial value clarification exercise and successfully incorporate numerous personal values in their decision.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51595" xml_f="51799" txt_i="39958" txt_f="40162">Finally, unconscious thinking may instill further benefits in medical contexts. First, other research demonstrates that individuals are more satisfied with the choices they make via unconscious thinking [</offsets><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="51832" xml_f="51833" txt_i="40162" txt_f="40163">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="51840" xml_f="52223" txt_i="40163" txt_f="40546">]. Thus, patients might experience more satisfaction with a treatment, and thus better adhere to it, if they chose that treatment following unconscious thought. Second, we investigated mock-patient decisions, but health practitioners might experience the greatest benefit from unconscious thought for complex medical decisions. For instance, research by Dijksterhuis and colleagues [</offsets><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="52256" xml_f="52257" txt_i="40546" txt_f="40547">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="52264" xml_f="52662" txt_i="40547" txt_f="40945">] showed that participants with more (vs little) expertise in a domain reach higher quality judgments after a period of unconscious thought. Thus, medical experts may realize the most advantage for choosing optimal treatments or generating accurate diagnoses in the face of complex and numerous symptoms, complications, side-effects, and risks, and some research already supports this possibility [</offsets><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="52696" xml_f="52698" txt_i="40945" txt_f="40947">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="52705" xml_f="52883" txt_i="40947" txt_f="41125">]. Given this, exploring the UTE in medical decision making for health care providers and patients has the potential to greatly and broadly enhance patient health and well-being.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number P20GM103474.
