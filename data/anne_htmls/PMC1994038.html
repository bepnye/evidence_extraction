The effect of different generations of beta blockers has been debated. Both metoprolol and carvedilol have demonstrated beneficial effects in placebo-controlled trials. In The Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET) two beta blockers were compared in a double-blind randomized matter. This is the first direct comparison between metoprolol and carvedilol of long-term effect on survival in patients with chronic heart failure. The all-cause mortality was signif icantly reduced in the favour of carvedilol. The dose and formulation of metoprolol used in this trial has caused debate, and it has been questioned whether a similar beta1-blockade is obtained in the two intervention groups. At this time there is an unresolved debate as to whether carvedilol is a superior beta-blocker or whether differences in beta1-blockade explained the results of COMET.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>beta-blockers</kwd><kwd>chronic heart failure</kwd><kwd>carvedilol</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="3243" xml_f="3255" txt_i="972" txt_f="984">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3266" xml_f="3388" txt_i="985" txt_f="1107">Heart failure is a growing problem with an increasing number of affected people and with an increasing burden on society (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24"><offsets xml_i="3420" xml_f="3434" txt_i="1107" txt_f="1121">Greenberg 2004</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="3441" xml_f="3746" txt_i="1121" txt_f="1426">). Much has been done to improve survival in patients with heart failure.

Even though preliminary data had shown that treatment with the beta1-blocker xamoterol in patients with CHF was a safe and effective treatment, the result of the trial was disappointing. No beneficial effect of treatment with xamoterol was observed. In an analysis of intention-to treat 9.1% of the patients in the xamoterol-treated group died within the first 100 days from randomization, compared with 3.7% in the placebo-treated group. Xamoterol has a major intrinsic sympatomimetic effect, which is not thought beneficial for use in patients with heart failure. The failure of xamoterol is generally attributed to the intrinsic sympatomimetic activity, but another important consideration is that the treatment was initiated with a high dose from the very start in patients with extreme risk.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7578" xml_f="7855" txt_i="4538" txt_f="4815">In CIBIS I (The Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study), bisoprolol was compared with placebo in 641 patients with CHF, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification III–IV, with a follow-up period of almost 2 years.

The trial was designed to evaluate the safety of treatment with carvedilol and mortality was observed as a secondary f inding. As for the primary end point, a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalization was found and worsening of heart failure was reduced in the group treated with carvedilol. A risk reduction of 65% was found in favour of carvedilol. The problem with interpreting the results of this study was that it was stopped early and was a meta-analysis of a group of studies designed to demonstrate symptomatic relief of carvedilol. These problems became secondary with the study of carvedilol in patients with severe heart failure. The Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival Study (COPERNICUS) trial was performed. 2289 patients with severe heart failure were randomized to receive carvedilol or placebo for a mean treatment period of 10.4 months (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41"><offsets xml_i="11274" xml_f="11291" txt_i="7874" txt_f="7891">Packer et al 2001</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11298" xml_f="11486" txt_i="7891" txt_f="8079">).

Metoprolol and bisoprolol belongs to the group of second generation beta-blockers with a specific beta1-blockade. The third-generation beta-blockers include carvedilol and bucindolol and have a non-selective beta-blocking effect on both beta1- as well as beta2adrenoceptors. Carvedilol further has an alpha-blocking effect which results in a vasodilating property. Bucindolol also has a vasodilating property. The reason for the vasodilating property of bucindolol has not clearly been demonstrated, but it may be because of an intrinsic sympatomimetic effect.

The question is then whether this formulation can improve mortality and is worthy of comparison with carvedilol. In the MDC trial, treatment with IR metoprolol in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy resulted in a 34% reduction in primary end-point, which was of all-cause mortality or need for heart transplantation. Need for transplantation was used as an expression for deterioration of heart failure. No reduction in all-cause mortality was observed, possibly due to a very low number of deaths in the trial. But when follow up was extended a beneficial effect on mortality was indeed observed with IR metroprolol (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35"><offsets xml_i="18524" xml_f="18532" txt_i="14218" txt_f="14226">MDC 1998</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18539" xml_f="18883" txt_i="14226" txt_f="14570">). The basic question is, whether the apparent superior effect on mortality seen with carvedilol compared with IR metoprolol, has any relevance to a higher dose and more sustained blockade that is obtained with 200mg of CR metoprolol as was used in MERIT-HF.
