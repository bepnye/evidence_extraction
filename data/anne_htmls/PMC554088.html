However, the specific marker of bone resorption, urinary Dpd, was not altered. A number of clinical studies have evaluated the effects of soy protein with its isoflavones on bone biomarkers. Overall, the effects of soy and/or its isoflavones have produced no consistent effects on biomarkers of bone turnover.

In the present study, participants were asked to consume a lower amount of soy protein (only 25 g providing 60 mg of isoflavones/day). It is possible that the reduced dose of soy in this study may have contributed to the lack of effect on bone resorption (as assessed by Dpd excretion) and that a dose-response study may be justified in order to achieve both increases in markers of bone formation and reductions in markers of bone resorption. Nevertheless, the positive changes in biomarkers of bone formation in the present study have not translated to increases in BMD and BMC.

Future studies are needed to address numerous questions including but not limited to whether: 1) isoflavones independent of soy protein can prevent ovarian hormone deficiency-associated bone loss; 2) consumption of soy containing food or intake of isoflavones on a daily basis is necessary to observe the expected beneficial effects on bone or simply intermittent use will produce the same results; 3) the effect of soy protein or its isoflavones on bone is transitory; and 4) the combination of soy isoflavones and lower doses of antiresorptive agents can prevent postmenopausal bone mineral loss. As these and other questions are answered, the efficacy of soy protein and its isoflavones as alternative and/or adjunctive treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis can be determined.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="30596" xml_f="30615" txt_i="22631" txt_f="22650">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="30626" xml_f="30686" txt_i="22651"
