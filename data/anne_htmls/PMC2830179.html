However, while antiresorptive drugs such as bisphosphonates, hormone therapy, and raloxifenes may address the specific bone deficits, the majority do not directly affect the pain and physical impairments that accompany prevalent vertebral fractures.

A number of centres were needed to geographically cover the metropolitan region. The treatment was standardized and the therapists were trained prior to the study to deliver the treatment. A comprehensive treatment manual and DVD were produced for the therapists and the importance of following the protocol emphasised. However, it was considered important to allow the therapists to adjust the intensity of the standardised manual treatment techniques and exercise prescription to match the participants' physical capabilities and change in clinical status: thus the dosage could be altered as required. Deletion of techniques or exercises was permitted if the therapist deemed them inappropriate.

The aims of the physiotherapy treatment were to i) decrease back pain; ii) improve posture; iii) improve thoracic spine mobility; iv) strengthen trunk extensor and lower limb muscles; v) improve trunk control; vi) provide education. The therapist applied postural taping which was worn full-time for the first week. A protective skin barrier followed by non-rigid, hypoallergenic tape was firstly applied to provide skin protection, followed by rigid strapping tape for postural adjustments and proprioceptive feedback. The taping technique aimed to encourage a retracted scapular and pectoral girdle posture and promote thoracic spine extension. At each treatment session the therapist also performed soft tissue massage and passive accessory central posterior-anterior mobilisation techniques on the thoracic spine. Furthermore, the therapist provided education regarding the aetiology and pathophysiology of osteoporosis, the origin of the pain, the aims of treatment, the importance of patient involvement and adherence, back care, postural awareness and activities to avoid in order to foster positive self management behaviours. The therapist taught the patient exercises to be performed at home: those exercises that addressed posture and range of motion were performed daily whilst strengthening and trunk control exercises were performed three times per week. A 10 week intervention was chosen to allow sufficient time to achieve strength gains in postural muscles and increase spinal mobility [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><offsets xml_i="14918" xml_f="14920" txt_i="9542" txt_f="9544">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14927" xml_f="14928" txt_i="9544" txt_f="9545">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="14960" xml_f="14962" txt_i="9545" txt_f="9547">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14969" xml_f="14971" txt_i="9547" txt_f="9549">].</offsets></p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="15019" xml_f="15026" txt_i="9550" txt_f="9557">Table 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="15046" xml_f="15085" txt_i="9557" txt_f="9596">Physiotherapy and home exercise program</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><offsets xml_i="15164" xml_f="15182" txt_i="9597" txt_f="9615">Technique/Exercise</offsets></th><th align="left"><offsets xml_i="15204" xml_f="15210" txt_i="9615" txt_f="9621">Dosage</offsets></th><th align="center"><offsets xml_i="15234" xml_f="15239" txt_i="9621" txt_f="9626">Weeks</offsets></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="15285" xml_f="15302" txt_i="9626" txt_f="9643">Postural taping *</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="15324" xml_f="15338" txt_i="9644" txt_f="9658">Worn full time</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="15362" xml_f="15363" txt_i="9659" txt_f="9660">1</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="15394" xml_f="15485" txt_i="9661" txt_f="9752"> from anterior aspect of each shoulder, posteriorly and obliquely down to opposite rib cage</offsets></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="15534" xml_f="15555" txt_i="9755" txt_f="9776">Soft tissue massage *</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="15577" xml_f="15583" txt_i="9777" txt_f="9783">5 mins</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="15607" xml_f="15611" txt_i="9784" txt_f="9788">1-10</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="15642" xml_f="15752" txt_i="9789" txt_f="9899"> Performed in prone to erector spinae, rhomboids, upper trapezius -stroking, circular frictions and petrissage</offsets></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="15801" xml_f="15860" txt_i="9902" txt_f="9961">Passive accessory postero-anterior vertebral mobilisation *</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="15882" xml_f="15935" txt_i="9962" txt_f="10015">5 mobilising movements at each central level × 2 reps</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="15959" xml_f="15963" txt_i="10016" txt_f="10020">1-10</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="15994" xml_f="16104" txt_i="10021" txt_f="10131"> In prone starting at T1 down to 2 levels below the most painful vertebral region Grade 2-3 depending on level</offsets></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="16153" xml_f="16186" txt_i="10134" txt_f="10167">Supine lying over rolled up towel</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="16208" xml_f="16217" txt_i="10168" txt_f="10177">5-10 mins</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="16241" xml_f="16242" txt_i="10178" txt_f="10179">1</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="16273" xml_f="16345" txt_i="10180" txt_f="10252"> Towel placed lengthways along the back to facilitate thoracic extension</offsets></td><td></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="16378" xml_f="16383" txt_i="10254" txt_f="10259">Daily</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="16414" xml_f="16466" txt_i="10260" txt_f="10312">Erect sitting with transversus abdominus stabilising</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="16488" xml_f="16508" txt_i="10313" txt_f="10333">10 sec hold × 5 reps</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="16532" xml_f="16536" txt_i="10334" txt_f="10338">1-10</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="16567" xml_f="16678" txt_i="10339" txt_f="10450"> Sitting forward on a chair or stool with no back rest.
