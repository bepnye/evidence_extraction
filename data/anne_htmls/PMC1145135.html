To reach this amount by dietary changes alone may be difficult because food has a low folic acid content and bioavailability. No studies have compared the effects of similar amounts of additional folate derived from a combination of folate-rich and fortified foods or folic acid from supplements on plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations, which was the aim of this study. Methods: Twenty male patients with hyperhomocysteinemia and coronary artery disease were included in a randomized, crossover intervention trial. Patients were treated daily with a combination of foods containing approximately 500 μg of folate or with one 500 μg capsule of synthetic folic acid over two five-week periods separated by a five-week wash-out period. Results: Plasma folate increased markedly (p&lt;0.001) and plasma tHcy decreased (p&lt;0.001) with both therapies. Folate-rich foods decreased tHcy by 8.6% (95% CI: –15.9 to –1.2) and synthetic folic acid capsules by 8% (95% CI: –13.3 to –2.7). Conclusions: This study shows, for the first time in the literature, that a folate-rich diet is as effective as folic acid capsules in decreasing plasma tHcy concentrations and adds further support to the recommendation of those diets to prevent cardiovascular disease.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Folate</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>folic acid</kwd><kwd>homocysteine.</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title><offsets xml_i="6113" xml_f="6128" txt_i="1370" txt_f="1385">1.

No relationship between treatment order and the effects of therapy was observed; therefore this variable was not considered in the statistical analysis. For all dependent variables, percent changes were calculated as the difference between baseline and follow-up measures divided by the baseline measure, with the result multiplied by 100.

A reasonable approach for increasing folate intake is to include larger amounts of folate-rich foods in the diet, i.e. leafy green vegetables, fruits, legumes and ready-to-eat fortified cereals. Such an approach was used in this study by supplying participants with a moderate amount of folate-rich foods providing an average of 500 μg folate daily. This dose of folate was selected since it was higher than the minimal effective dose of 0.2 mg/day found to decrease homocysteine (20), and higher than the mean dietary folate intake in European men, but not high enough to be attained with a folate-rich diet.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18844" xml_f="19519" txt_i="12619" txt_f="13294">The toxicity of folic acid is extremely low even after prolonged use of high doses (21). It has been shown that folic acid in doses between 0.2 and 15 mg/day can lower plasma homocysteine levels without apparent toxicity. A main safety issue is the risk of neurologic disorders when high doses of folic acid are used in the presence of an underlying vitamin B12 deficiency. However, it is customary to rule out vitamin B12 deficiency before giving supplemental folate. Once folate therapy is initiated, it is usually maintained on a long-term basis, but until results of controlled clinical trials become available, no firm recommendations regarding that therapy can be made.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19526" xml_f="19834" txt_i="13295" txt_f="13603">Owing to the relative differences in bioavailability of naturally-occurring food folate and the more bioavailable synthetic folic acid, 100 μg of natural folate from unfortified foods has been equated to 60 μg of synthetic folic acid from fortified food and to 50 μg of synthetic folic acid from supplements </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="19866" xml_f="19868" txt_i="13603" txt_f="13605">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19875" xml_f="19995" txt_i="13605" txt_f="13725">.
