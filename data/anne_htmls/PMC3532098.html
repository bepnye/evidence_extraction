Despite the positive aspects of this life-style, there are also some medical problems: in particular, cartilage lesions are becoming one of the most important challenges for both basic researchers and clinicians. In fact, cartilage has limited healing potential for several reasons: first of all, the relative isolation from systemic regulation caused by the lack of nerves and vessels when compared to other tissues. Furthermore, its complex histological structure, consisting of chondrocytes surrounded by matrix made of a specialized framework of collagen, aggrecans and fluid, determines an intrinsic vulnerability that, starting from small and focal lesions, can develop into an accelerated degenerative process ending in osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic condition that is difficult to treat by conservative means. Eventually, this process often requires a sacrificing surgical approach such as metal resurfacing. Several treatments, both conservative and surgical, have been proposed to address cartilage pathology, but results are often only partially satisfactory and limited over time [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="8538" xml_f="8539" txt_i="3656" txt_f="3657">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8546" xml_f="8547" txt_i="3657" txt_f="3658">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="8578" xml_f="8579" txt_i="3658" txt_f="3659">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8586" xml_f="8588" txt_i="3659" txt_f="3661">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8595" xml_f="8935" txt_i="3662" txt_f="4002">Current research is investigating new methods for stimulating repair or replacing damaged cartilage.

harvesting to obtain autologous PRP which was used only in half of them, according to a randomization list (the randomization list, provided by an independent statistician, was kept in a dedicated office that was contacted by the physician by a phone call just before the injective procedure for the communication of the treatment allocation). The procedure consisted of a 150-ml venous blood sample for every knee treated. Then, 2 centrifugations (the first at 1480 rpm for 6 minutes to separate erythrocytes, and a second at 3400 rpm for 15 minutes to concentrate platelets) produced a unit (20 ml) of PRP. The unit of PRP was divided into 4 small units of 5 ml each. One unit was sent to the laboratory for analysis of platelet concentration and for a quality test, whereas 3 units were stored at −30°C. Freezing them allows the time to proceed with the quality analysis, and this could be considered as an advantage since it increases the safety of the procedure, thus ensuring a controlled not contaminated intra-articular delivery of the product. However, it has to be underlined that this could also be considered as a disadvantage: the alteration of the morphology and decrease in platelet functional properties, which includes degranulation of alpha-granules, after storing platelets in freezing conditions, is known. However, there are no data on the effect of freezing on the clinical results of platelet injections, and freeze-thawing is even one of the methods used for releasing intracellular GFs. Having freshly-harvested PRP might preserve all the platelet functions better, but currently the data are still controversial and it is uncertain whether freeze-thawing adversely affects their properties to the point of impairing their clinical efficacy.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19253" xml_f="19803" txt_i="11085" txt_f="11635">One week after blood harvesting the injection cycle was started, with 3 weekly injections of PRP or HA. At the time of injection the syringe was appropriately covered to prevent patients from discovering the substance they were receiving. In the case of PRP administration, the total number of platelets per milliliter in the PRP represented a mean increase of 5 times compared with whole blood values. In the platelet concentrate the presence of leukocytes was also observed, with a concentration of 1.2 times with respect to the normal blood value.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19810" xml_f="20299" txt_i="11636" txt_f="12125">After the injection, patients were sent home with instructions to restrict the use of the leg for at least 24 hours and to use cold therapy/ice on the affected area to relieve pain. During this period, the use of non-steroidal medication was forbidden. During the treatment period, rest or mild activities (such as using an exercise bike or mild exercise in a pool) were permitted, and subsequently a gradual resumption of normal sport or recreational activities was allowed, as tolerated.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20315" xml_f="20335" txt_i="12126" txt_f="12146">Statistical analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20346" xml_f="21329" txt_i="12147" txt_f="13124">All continuous data were expressed in terms of the mean and the standard deviation of the mean.

The Least Significant Difference test was performed as a post-hoc pair-wise analysis of the Kruskal Wallis test. The generalized linear model for repeated measures with Sidak correction for multiple comparisons was performed to test differences of the scores at different follow-up times. The non-parametric Pearson’s Chi square test evaluated by Exact methods was performed to investigate the relationships between grouping variables. For all tests, p&lt;0.05 was considered significant.

To avoid indiscriminate and inappropriate use of PRP, it is important to determine the type of patients who will not benefit from this treatment, and therefore the authors designed a high level study to understand clearly the indication of this treatment. The present results suggest, conversely to what was shown by the current literature, that for middle-aged patients with moderate signs of OA, PRP did not offer better results compared to HA, and thus it should not be considered as first line treatment. More promising results are shown for its use in less degenerated cases, but they still need to be confirmed.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="42655" xml_f="42674" txt_i="27830" txt_f="27849">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42685" xml_f="42747" txt_i="27850" txt_f="27912">All the authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="42769" xml_f="42791" txt_i="27914" txt_f="27936">Authors’ contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="42802" xml_f="43205" txt_i="27937" txt_f="28340">EK and ADM were responsible for patients' enrollment and injective treatment; BDM and MLM were involved in patients' evaluation at the established follow-ups; GF was responsible for data analysis; GF and BDM were responsible for writing the paper; AC and PMF took care of PRP production and storage; MM performed the final revision of the article.
