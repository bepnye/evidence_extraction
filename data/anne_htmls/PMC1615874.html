The U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study has shown that blood pressure control as well as blood glucose control is efficient for prevention of complications in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus. However, some reports have shown that it is difficult to control the blood pressure and the concomitant use of a plurality of drugs is needed in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus. In recent years renin-angiotensin system depressants are increasingly used for the blood pressure control in diabetic patients. Particularly in Japan, angiotensin II (A II) antagonists are increasingly used.

When the efficacy of the initiated antihypertensive drug is inadequate, physicians adopt either the increase in dose of the antihypertensive drug or the combined use of another antihypertensive drug with the initiated drug as alternative choices. However, there are hardly any studies on comparison of these alternatives in terms of the antihypertensive effect or the influence on cardiovascular events.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33148" xml_f="33940" txt_i="21577" txt_f="22369">Some reports have shown that the combined use of antihypertensive drugs is needed to particularly HT patients with DM or nephropathy. Of these drugs, A II antagonists have been reported to have favorable influence on the renal function. In recent years the use of A II antagonists is increasingly used as the first-line medicine for HT patients with DM or nephropathy. On the other hand, it is also true that there are many patients who receive treatment by the combined use of a Ca blocker with the antagonist in many studies of evaluation of the efficacy of these drugs. The results of the meta-analysis in recent years have suggested that adequate control of blood pressure levels is also necessary for adequate exertion of the usefulness of RA system depressants in hypertensive patients.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33947" xml_f="34861" txt_i="22370" txt_f="23284">While it has been reported that there is correlation between the antihypertensive action and the dose of A II antagonists, some reports have shown that the increase in the antihypertensive effect is limited even by the increase in dose to more than the usual dose. Since an adverse effect of ACE inhibitors, a dry cough, is frequently observed in Japanese people, the shift to A.R.B. rapidly proceeded. However, NHI drug price of A.R.B. is high. With regard to the use at dose more than the usual dose, its efficacy needs to be reviewed from a viewpoint of medical cost-effectiveness. Based on the background, the ADVANCED-J study was designed to compare the increase in dose of A II antagonists and the combined use of amlodipine with an antagonist in terms of the antihypertensive effect in hypertensive patients whose blood pressure levels were inadequately controlled by single therapy with an A II antagonist.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34883" xml_f="34920" txt_i="23286" txt_f="23323">Assessment of the home blood pressure</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34931" xml_f="35384" txt_i="23324" txt_f="23777">The primary outcome measure of the ADVANCED-J study included the home blood pressure measured in the early morning. The prevalence of home blood pressure monitor in recent years has allowed comprehension of details of the blood pressure condition. As a result, the presence of so-called masked hypertension, which shows the inadequately controlled home blood pressure in spite of the controlled ambulatory blood pressure, has increasingly been revealed.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35391" xml_f="36574" txt_i="23778" txt_f="24961">It has been reported that the risk of cardiovascular events in masked hypertension patients is as high as that in persistent hypertension patients. The importance of 24-hour blood pressure control involving home blood pressure is increasingly recognized. In fact, it is not realistic on a point of principle or from the aspect of medical cost-effectiveness to conduct the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in all hypertensive patients. On the other hand, at least 30,000,000 home blood pressure monitors have been put on the market up to date in Japan, and it can be said from the global aspect that they have become more widespread in Japan. The blood pressure levels measured with home blood pressure monitors, particularly those measured at the time of rising in the morning, have been reported to reflect changes in blood pressure during the course from the night to the early morning. The correlation between blood pressure levels at home in the morning and the onset of cardiovascular events has also been reported. It is considered important for suppression of cardiovascular events in HT patients with DM to control the home blood pressures measured in the morning.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36581" xml_f="37114" txt_i="24962" txt_f="25495">There are many DM patients who show the non-dipper type of changes in blood pressure, i.e., the type which shows an only slight spontaneous decrease in blood pressure during the night (because of poor control of the autonomic nervous system and of renal hypofunction), and the home blood pressures measured in the morning are predicted to be high in them. It is therefore considered important for prevention of the onset of cardiovascular events to control the home blood pressure measured in the morning even in HT patients with DM.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37121" xml_f="37646" txt_i="25496" txt_f="26021">However, there have been only few or no comparative studies on drugs, which have focused on home blood pressures measured in the morning in HT patients with DM. There have been no studies on the point of which is more efficient for controlling of home blood pressures measured in the early morning, the increase in dose of A II antagonists or the additional combined use of a Ca blocker. Based on these circumstances, the home blood pressures in the morning were adopted to evaluation of blood pressure control in this study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37653" xml_f="38125" txt_i="26022" txt_f="26494">The compliance of recording by patients and bias due to selection of levels at the time of data recording have influence on reliability of the measurement of blood pressure levels at home. For this reason, the i-monitoring system was adopted to the ADVANCED-J study, and all the blood pressure levels measured were semiautomatically accumulated in the Data Center. All the data from the measurements and the summary data were supplied to physicians via web when necessary.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38147" xml_f="38177" txt_i="26496" txt_f="26526">Assessment of arteriosclerosis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38188" xml_f="39406" txt_i="26527" txt_f="27745">It has been believed that arteriosclerosis is more likely to progress in DM patients. According to Kawamori et al., it is clear that intimal-medial thickening (IMT), i.e., an indicator of systemic arteriosclerosis, has been increased even in the pre-stage of DM (IFG, IGT). As methods of assessing arteriosclerosis in the coronary artery, various techniques, such as quantitative coronary arteriography, intravascular ultrasonography, multi-slice CT, MRI, etc., have been developed. It is impossible to widely use these techniques because of some problems with invasion to patients, exposure to radiation and magnetism, etc. and of procedural complexity of measurement. The assessment of IMT by cervical arterial echography or the evaluation of baPWV by measurements of pulse waves at the wrist and ankle yields no invasion to patients. These techniques are methods of assessing arteriosclerosis, which rarely allow physical load to patients. Even for general clinics, these techniques are the less invasive methods for assessment, which are simple to maneuver. IMT and baPWV were applied as indicators in this study, and the influence of antihypertensive therapy on progression of arteriosclerosis was also evaluated.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="39434" xml_f="39444" txt_i="27748" txt_f="27758">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="39455" xml_f="39945" txt_i="27759" txt_f="28249">The ADVANCED-J study is a prospective clinical study that is designed to compare the increase in dose of A II antagonist and the combined use of a Ca blocker, amlodipine, in terms of the efficacy for blood pressure control in DM+HT patients whose blood pressure levels are inadequately controlled by the single treatment with an A II antagonist. This study is different from the usual previous studies in that home blood pressures are assessed as indicators of evaluation of blood pressure.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39952" xml_f="40271" txt_i="28250" txt_f="28569">The ADVANCED-J study may have much influence on selection of antihypertensive drugs for treatment in HT patients with DM.
