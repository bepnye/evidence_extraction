All patients were likely to receive the service, given their probable survival. Thus patients were randomised to either receive the intervention immediately (fast track) or to receive standard best practice alone for three months and then be offered the intervention (standard best practice).

These were available to all those who received the new palliative care service immediately and after a delay. Amongst the services available were nurses (including nurses specialising in MS), physiotherapy, neurology and rehabilitation services. On average MS specialist nurses contacted people with MS by telephone at least once every 6 months, more if patients had greater need, and visited when appropriate. In addition, district nurses, social services  and general practitioners provided support in the community. A few patients received home physiotherapy, occupational therapy and/or attended specialist rehabilitation services or clinics. Most had seen a neurologist within the last 6 months and many were still under the care of the neurologist, although hospital attendance as an out-patient was more difficult for those with severe disability. In-patient care was available as required, particularly for the treatment of infections, although this was seldom on wards with specialist knowledge of MS or disability. In-patient rehabilitation was available to some patients, as were other specialist services, including continence advice, psychiatry and/or psychology. Most patients were entitled to some financial benefits because of their disability, which went towards their costs of care. Charities such as the MS Society provided information on available services and organised support groups. In addition, carers, usually family members and friends, supported many patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24304" xml_f="24333" txt_i="17460" txt_f="17489">Intervention: the new service</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="24344" xml_f="25938" txt_i="17490" txt_f="19084">The new service was offered in addition to the standard best practice services outlined above.

It comprised a part-time palliative medicine consultant (who had received training in palliative medicine and had experience in neurology), a nurse with immediate experience of working as a nurse specialist in neurology, and with some palliative care training, a psychosocial worker (also part of the existing palliative care team), and a service co-ordinator/administrator. Patients were visited by the service in their own homes, or in some instances, depending on circumstances, were seen in day units, rehabilitation centres, nursing homes or in hospital. After an initial assessment, treatment was recommended and follow-up occurred as required. The services aimed to provide a quality comprehensive palliative care assessment and suggest ways to improve management of physical, emotional, social and other problems, provide specialist welfare benefits advice and bereavement support, liaise with and act as a catalyst with local services, both primary and specialist teams, enable crisis prevention and to develop education and support for primary and secondary care.

However, a search of Medline from 1966 – July 2006 found no formal reports of its use in palliative care, hospice care or terminal care. This study demonstrated how the framework might be used in modelling and evaluating a new palliative care service. There were several positive aspects to the approach. The Service Modelling phase gave valuable information on the detail of the structures and processes of the service, and in addition helped to raise awareness of the service. There was an opportunity for a wide range of disciplines, including rehabilitation medicine, neurology, palliative care, professionals allied to medicine, general practice and various branches of nursing to feed into the design of the service. We believe this helped to improve working relationships with other services. The local patient data helped to confirm local need and the precise modelling of the service. In phase II, embarking on a preliminary evaluation, was, we feel, more cost-effective than attempting a definitive stage III randomised controlled trial. The phase II nature of the trial will allow us to test the feasibility of trial methods, and the data from this trial will aid selection of design, measures and calculation of sample sizes for a larger definitive trial should this be appropriate.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41105" xml_f="41234" txt_i="31486" txt_f="31615">Tilling et al used the MRC Framework to develop a family support organiser service and to refine outcome measures for evaluation[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38"><offsets xml_i="41266" xml_f="41268" txt_i="31615" txt_f="31617">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41275" xml_f="41555" txt_i="31617" txt_f="31897">].

In the preclinical (theoretical) phase, a theoretically based framework for a small group course for carers of people with stroke was developed. The intervention was grounded in a cognitive behavioural model and included carers' needs identified from a literature review. Phase I (modelling phase) comprised a qualitative study involving one-to-one semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of informal carers of people with stroke. Following this, the intervention was modified. In phase II (exploratory phase), the modified intervention was delivered by a clinical psychologist and stroke nurse practitioner to five carers. The course was further refined and delivered to seven new carers who subsequently completed a satisfaction questionnaire.

Furthermore, our preliminary evaluation (phase II) was far more extensive than either of these studies. Robinson et al interviewed only 12 carers, and Tilling et al virtually omitted the phase. However, given the difficulty of trials in palliative care [40, 41, 42], and the number of trials that experience serious problems with recruitment, attrition and contamination, we feel that a detailed phase II study was warranted. In the development of drugs and other therapies, phase I and phase II studies are often given considerable time and attention, and findings are often published in very high impact factor journals. It is time, perhaps that such attention is given to palliative service developments at phase I and II. By introducing a randomised trial at phase II we will be able to test the trial method as well as the intervention.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43812" xml_f="44568" txt_i="34025" txt_f="34781">The use of a delayed intervention randomised trial in palliative care is also novel. We are aware of no other study in palliative care that has used this design. Often this approach is not realistic; palliative care patients usually die so quickly that those in the delayed intervention group will not receive the intervention. However, the design is used in rehabilitation studies, and this group of patients was accustomed to wait for longer periods for outpatient appointments etc. Therefore, this design was deemed as appropriate and was acceptable to people with MS, carers and professionals. We suggest that as palliative care moves forward into non-cancer conditions, where survival is longer and less easy to predict, this design would be of value.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44590" xml_f="44609" txt_i="34783" txt_f="34802">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44620" xml_f="44680" txt_i="34803" txt_f="34863">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44702" xml_f="44724" txt_i="34865" txt_f="34887">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44735" xml_f="45912" txt_i="34888" txt_f="36065">IJH co-conceived the study and design, co-applied for funding, oversaw all study conduct and developed the analysis plan.
