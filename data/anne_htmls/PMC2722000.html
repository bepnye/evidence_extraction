Antibiotic prophylaxis can prevent rebleeding in patients with acute gastroesophageal variceal bleeding (GEVB). The aim of the study was to compare prophylactic third generation cephalosporins with on-demand antibiotics for the prevention of gastroesophageal variceal rebleeding.

Prophylactic quinolone can thus further reduce the rebleeding rate in cirrhotic patients with GEVB. However, the use of prophylactic antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance with potentially disastrous consequences. It is necessary to prove the benefit of other antibiotics including third generation cephalosporins in preventing rebleeding in cirrhotic patients with GEVB.
