Patients undergoing elective neurosurgical procedures sometimes require large volumes of intravenous fluid to maintain hemodynamic homeostasis during surgery. However, these volumes may leave patients with an excessive fluid load that increases risks for various complications such as the formation of cerebral edema, which is detrimental during neurosurgical procedures. The main goal of intraoperative fluid management is to achieve hemodynamic homeostasis via the administration of small fluid volumes while avoiding fluid overload (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-cln_68p323"><offsets xml_i="6938" xml_f="6939" txt_i="2441" txt_f="2442">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6946" xml_f="7096" txt_i="2442" txt_f="2592">).

The plasma potassium concentrations in both groups displayed biphasic changes with increases at the earlier time points and decreases at the later time points. The concentrations never exceeded the normal clinical range, which might be due to the multiple additive effects such as hemodilution from volume expansion at the earlier time points and the diuretic effect from the mannitol at the later time points. Moreover, we found that the plasma calcium concentration decreased in both groups. Two reasons may account for the hypocalcaemia: intraoperative bleeding can lead to the loss of calcium; and hemodilution occurred from the volume expansion of the HS-HES or HES treatments, which did not contain calcium. However, even though no neurologic deficits were found in the present study, it is still necessary to monitor the electrolyte concentrations when an HS-HES solution is infused. Not surprisingly, a clear increase in plasma osmolality was observed after the HS-HES infusion but not after the HES infusion. This increase is one of the known mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of HS-HES treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29436" xml_f="30246" txt_i="21956" txt_f="22766">In conclusion, a 7.2% HS - 6% HES solution infused after the induction of anesthesia is an attractive choice for fluid management during neurosurgical procedures. HS-HES infusion can reduce the volume of intraoperative fluid required to maintain the patients undergoing surgery and can lead to a decrease in the intraoperative fluid balance. Furthermore, the majority of the total fluid input reduction (61%) was due to the difference in the volume of HES (1,000 mL) and HS-HES (250 mL) initially administered. A reduction in the administration of Ringer's solution accounted for 39% of the difference. Moreover, HS-HES decreased the dural tension scores and provided satisfactory brain relaxation. Our results indicate that HS-HES may represent a new avenue for volume therapy during neurosurgical procedures.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1-cln_68p323"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
