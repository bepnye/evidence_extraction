muscular torticollis (CMT) according to head rotation. [Subjects and Methods] 70 infants
with CMT were divided into grade I, grade II, and grade III according to the asymmetry of
cervical rotation. Patients received ultrasound and massage therapy for 30 minutes, in
conjunction with passive stretching exercises, 3 times a week. Repeated measurement
results from interventions were presented from baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Asymmetry
was evaluated by head tilt (HT) and the torticollis overall assessment (TOA). [Results]
The TOA measured at 3 months and 6 months showed a significant difference in inter group
scores and an intra group interaction with grade and rating scale was observed. In
contrast, HT was significantly different in intra group comparison, but no significant
difference in inter and intra group interaction was observed in the angle and grade.
[Conclusion] Conservative physical therapy showed lasting effects according to the
intervention period over 3 months and 6 months of repeated measurements over time in TOA
and HT. Especially, TOA showed significant differences in asymmetric changes according to
the cervical rotation.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Congenital muscular torticollis</kwd><kwd>Head rotation</kwd><kwd>Torticollis overall assessment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="4768" xml_f="4780" txt_i="1265" txt_f="1277">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4791" xml_f="4945" txt_i="1278" txt_f="1432">Congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) manifests as an asymmetric head inclination with
