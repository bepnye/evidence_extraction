The RE-AIM framework was developed in part to encourage greater emphasis on issues of external validity and thus help close the gap between research and adoption, a gap that can be attributed at least partially to the almost exclusive preoccupation of health promotion research with efficacy studies focused on internal validity. The RE-AIM model encompasses the dimensions of Reach (participant participation rate and representativeness); Effectiveness (including impact on quality of life and potential negative outcomes); Adoption (by representative settings and clinicians); Implementation consistency by various staff; and Maintenance at both the patient and the setting levels.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="10165" xml_f="10172" txt_i="4853" txt_f="4860">Methods</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="10192" xml_f="10204" txt_i="4861" txt_f="4873">Study design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10215" xml_f="10279" txt_i="4874" txt_f="4938">Full details of the study design have been published elsewhere [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"><offsets xml_i="10311" xml_f="10313" txt_i="4938" txt_f="4940">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10320" xml_f="10321" txt_i="4940" txt_f="4941">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25"><offsets xml_i="10353" xml_f="10355" txt_i="4941" txt_f="4943">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10362" xml_f="10485" txt_i="4943" txt_f="5066">].

One-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to evaluate between-condition differences at baseline. Repeated measures multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA), covarying out the effect of baseline scores, were used to compare long-term results on each of the three sets of outcome measures at 6, 12, and 24 months across conditions. Follow-up univariate analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were conducted to reveal the source of effects only when the MANCOVA was significant in a given domain. To aid interpretation, the results reported in all tables have not been adjusted for baseline values.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="29635" xml_f="29656" txt_i="22055" txt_f="22076">Additional covariates</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="29667" xml_f="30148" txt_i="22077" txt_f="22558">Prior to conducting the repeated measures MANCOVAs, univariate statistics and correlation matrices were examined for potential additional correlates of the behavioral and psychosocial dependent variables.

A strength of the study is use of the RE-AIM framework and inclusion of cost and cost-effectiveness measures. Both the cost and the cost-effectiveness estimates are relatively high compared to other estimates, and there are likely multiple reasons for this. The most obvious is that this was an intensive intervention that continued for 24 months and the costs of ongoing group meetings added up to a large sum over time. It could be that alternative or less-expensive maintenance approaches could be developed. The women who participated in this trial were at extremely high risk for further CHD-related diseases, which are major causes of health care expenditures as well as mortality. For them, a program with this level of intensity may be warranted, as the overall cost of the intervention is considerably less than invasive surgical or even some intensive pharmacologic or cardiac rehabilitation interventions [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45"><offsets xml_i="57761" xml_f="57763" txt_i="37850" txt_f="37852">45</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="57770" xml_f="57899" txt_i="37852" txt_f="37981">].

The higher estimates at follow-up are partially due to shrinking differences between intervention and control conditions decreased over time, caused by some slippage in the intervention condition and improvements on some outcomes (e.g., quality of life) in the control condition.
