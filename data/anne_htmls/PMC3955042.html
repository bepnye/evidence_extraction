The most frequent reasons suggested for discontinuation were drug related side-effects, insufficient motivation to treatment and fear of side-effects unlike our study. Safety concerns were very common for hormone replacement therapy, lack of motivation was the most common cause for calcium and vitamin D and drug related side-effects for RIS, ALN and raloxifen. However, result of our study recorded an alarmingly high discontinuation rate of BP and concomitant treatment, priority for co-morbid conditions, unawareness, cost of treatment and daily requirement of calcium and vitamin D were the most frequent reasons for non-adherence.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15793" xml_f="15805" txt_i="9352" txt_f="9364">Papaioannou </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="15813" xml_f="15819" txt_i="9364" txt_f="9370">et al.</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="15828" xml_f="15829" txt_i="9370" txt_f="9371">[</offsets><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="15863" xml_f="15865" txt_i="9371" txt_f="9373">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15872" xml_f="16499" txt_i="9373" txt_f="10000">] in their study suggested that 20-30% of patients taking daily or weekly treatments of BP may suspend their treatment within 6-12 months of initiating therapy due to drug-induced ADR and fear of ADR.

However, ADR, intolerance and fear of ADR were not the most common factors responsible for discontinuation of BP in our study.
