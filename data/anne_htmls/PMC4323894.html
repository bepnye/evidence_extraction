Group A consisted of patients who had therapy with direct regional brain cooling and group B consisted of patients who did not have direct regional brain cooling therapy. There was no blinding done after assignment to interventions. All recruited patients received monitoring for ICP, brain oxygen and brain temperature using ICP and Licox probes (GMS, Kiel-Mielkendorf, Germany). ICP probe was inserted into the ventricle or brain parenchyma whilst Licox probe for brain oxygen and temperature was placed into the damaged brain areas.

The temperature range of initial infused fluid was used as the basis to analyze and to further divide Group A into two groups: (1) Deep cooling at a temperature of 20-29°C and (2) mild cooling at a temperature of 30-36°C. The cold infusion was achieved via neurojaf external ventricular drainage (EVD) with multiple side-holes catheter, which was inserted superior to the dura flap and at the inner surface of the dura, sprinkled onto the surface of the swollen brain. The catheter was in contact with the surface of the brain. The 500 ml of Hartmann's solution infusion rate was scheduled within 7 h (70 ml/h). Owing to patients’ head position setting in the Intensive Care Unit, a second larger draining tube was inserted at the lower part of the craniectomy flap outside the dura, which was loosely closed to drain the excess fluid with a low suction pressure. The temperature of the infused Hartmann's solution was regularly monitored through the three way connector draining the fluid out to the collection port for temperature assessment. If the drained solution's temperature was under or above the intended value (s), the preceding infusion was replaced by a new solution with the correct intended temperature. An immediate CT scan of the brain was indicated if patients’ ICP showed persistently raised values despite standard therapies being given. This was to exclude any new surgical lesions and/or the retention of infused solution as a cause of raised ICP. However, if the ICP hold within normal values, the CT scan was repeated after 48 h of therapy.</offsets></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="15385" xml_f="15393" txt_i="10374" txt_f="10382">Figure 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="15413" xml_f="15601" txt_i="10382" txt_f="10570">(a) Neurointensive care monitoring and therapy for patients in this study.

The proposed neuroprotective mechanisms include: (a) Hypothermia can inhibit the activation of caspase enzymes, (b) prevents or mitigates mitochondrial dysfunction, (c) decreases the metabolism as well as decrease the overload of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and free oxygen radicals, (d) modifies the cellular disorders of intracellular ion concentrations, (e) suppresses the inflammatory and immunological responses and epileptic activity, (f) reduces the disruption in blood brain barrier, vascular permeability and edema, (g) improves the microcirculatory circuits and intra- and extra-cellular acidosis, (h) corrects the hyperthermia after brain injury and influence the local secretion of various vasoactive mediators secreted by the endothelium, and (i) enhances expression of immediate early genes and cold shock proteins. Building on the vast benefits of cerebral hypothermia, we did a prospective study to test the null hypothesis, “cerebral hypothermia has no benefit on severely injured traumatic brain with initial GCS of 6 and 7”. In the design of our study, several important issues related to induced hypothermia were put into context. First, the area of injury should be cooled. Therefore, brain cooling is the target, not body or scalp cooling. This was thought possible in patients who had decompressive craniectomy and irrigating the brain surface with cold Hartmann's solution and with second drainage tube situated outside the dura which was loosely closed. Furthermore, our experience from endoscopic intraventricular neurosurgery, by routinely irrigating the brain with a large amount of fluid seems safe, without inducing high rate of infectious complications. Second, brain temperature can be different from measured temperature of cooling method or therapy given to the patients. Statement saying “the brain was cooled to certain temperature degree needs to be stated cautiously.” Measured brain temperature depends on many factors, including the location or site of the measuring tip as the inflamed area of the brain would manifest higher brain temperature than non- or less-inflamed brain area.[</offsets><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="31091" xml_f="31093" txt_i="22716" txt_f="22718">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31100" xml_f="31332" txt_i="22718" txt_f="22950">] Third, by applying the concept of increase brain pulsation during compensatory phase of raise ICP, the irrigated regional fluid hopefully will be distributed to other brain regions via principles of vascular and brain pulsations.[</offsets><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="31366" xml_f="31368" txt_i="22950" txt_f="22952">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31375" xml_f="31467" txt_i="22952" txt_f="23044">] Finally, induced hypothermia for the brain can be made below 32°C.

This finding may conclude that cooling the injured brain has indeed the potential benefits. The benefits of brain hypothermia for the severely injured brain can be explained based upon the pathophysiology of secondary brain injury as discussed above and also because of our method of cooling-our study applied direct regional brain cooling which means the cooling effect was directed toward the region of interests and perhaps via CSF pulsation, the residual cooling effect might have been distributed to the whole brain surfaces. This direct method of brain cooling is currently thought feasible for patients who had decompressive craniectomy. Further analysis on cooling-treated patients after stratifying them into two groups disclosed interesting findings: (a) Mild cooling group, treated at temperature of 30-36°C had fared better 6 months outcomes when compared to no cooling group and b) there was no significant difference for the 6 months post-trauma outcomes when the deep cooling group (temperature ranges from 20°C to 29°C) was compared to the non-cooling group. This signifies mild cooling-treated patients has the most significant benefits; and despite no apparent difference in the incidence of treatment complications, the deep cooling group surprisingly failed to be equally better as mild cooling group. The beneficial effects of mild brain cooling at temperature 30-36°C can partly be explained by our monitored parameters as discussed below.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title><offsets xml_i="34287" xml_f="34338" txt_i="25609" txt_f="25660">Monitored and studied parameters; and brain cooling</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34349" xml_f="34435" txt_i="25661" txt_f="25747">Various study on hypothermia did notice reduction in ICPs, improvement in CPPs or PtiO</offsets><sub><offsets xml_i="34440" xml_f="34441" txt_i="25747" txt_f="25748">2</offsets></sub><offsets xml_i="34447" xml_f="34513" txt_i="25748" txt_f="25814"> after cerebral hypothermia, which translated to better outcomes.[</offsets><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34547" xml_f="34549" txt_i="25814" txt_f="25816">26</offsets></xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34590" xml_f="34592" txt_i="25816" txt_f="25818">27</offsets></xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34633" xml_f="34635" txt_i="25818" txt_f="25820">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34642" xml_f="34947" txt_i="25820" txt_f="26125">] Since our study recruited only trauma patients with severe head injury and required decompressive craniectomy, reduction in ICP was not expected to be a major determinant correlated with outcomes, obviously because decompressive craniectomy itself has been shown to cause significant reduction in ICPs.[</offsets><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34981" xml_f="34983" txt_i="26125" txt_f="26127">29</offsets></xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="35024" xml_f="35026" txt_i="26127" txt_f="26129">30</offsets></xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="35067" xml_f="35069" txt_i="26129" txt_f="26131">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="35076" xml_f="35552" txt_i="26131" txt_f="26607">] This could also be a reason why, majority of our treated patients with direct regional brain cooling had induced cerebral hypothermia for period up to 48 h only (short period).
