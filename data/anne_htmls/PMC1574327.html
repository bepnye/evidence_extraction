We found a significantly higher percent of EP participants compared to FD attending the office of any health care provider. We also found significant group differences in the number of visits, with the EP group attending a significantly higher number of visits to any provider. There did not appear to be any group differences in self-care habits, however we did note that most participants did three things: modified their movement (increased or decreased their activities), applied external therapies or back supports, and self medicated.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48381" xml_f="49164" txt_i="30294" txt_f="31077">We hypothesized that there would be no group difference in the average number of visits to any health care provider. The results demonstrated that actually there were significant group differences during the year after trial participation, with a higher number of visits to any health care provider and to a general practitioner in the EP group. These results are the first to assess this difference, and a future focus on this issue is encouraged because number of visits relates to (1) the continued pain or disability after a clinical trial is complete and (2) added cost beyond that incurred within the trial. Maetzel and Li stated that "the cost of illness of low back pain is high and is comparable to other disorders such as headache, heart disease, depression, or diabetes" [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="49196" xml_f="49198" txt_i="31077" txt_f="31079">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49205" xml_f="49391" txt_i="31079" txt_f="31265">].

Major differences include higher utilization rates in the EP group for exercising at home; paying for yard/house work; and utilizing back creams, over the counter medications, and supplementations; and meditation practices. Future studies may inquire if such self-care was utilized as back pain treatments or if such care was to prevent further back pain.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49878" xml_f="50472" txt_i="31740" txt_f="32334">Several factors may have affected the results of this study. First of all, missing data was an issue which was attempted to be resolved by annualization of the data. However, annualizing the data does not necessarily reflect the actual amount of health care used by the participants, rather it reflects the approximate use of care based on the dates in which utilization data were collected. In future studies, self-report data could be compared with insurance records to verify health care provider types and numbers of visits. However, verification of self-report of self care is a challenge.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="50479" xml_f="51020" txt_i="32335" txt_f="32876">A second factor possibly affecting the results was that the type of practitioner visited and the number of visits is strongly dictated by insurance coverage, a factor we did not measure in this study. We expect that the coverage within this study was equal among groups based on the random nature of the study, however this information was not verified. Similarly, we did not collect data on co-pay amount, limitations to access of care, or re-injury; all issues which may have affected the amount of care utilized during the year post-care.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51027" xml_f="51582" txt_i="32877" txt_f="33432">A third possible bias is that only participants who completed the treatments within the clinical trial were followed after care and included in this study. Participants who did not complete the trial may have chosen different courses of care than the participants who did complete the study, creating a sampling bias within our assessed population. We did not follow any participant who did not complete participation within the clinical trial so were not able to compare the follow up data between the participants who did and did not complete the study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51589" xml_f="51795" txt_i="33433" txt_f="33639">A final potential limiting factor for consideration in this and the associated publication is that a number of statistical tests have been performed on these data which increases the chance of type 1 error.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51802" xml_f="52145" txt_i="33640" txt_f="33983">This was the first study to assess the amount of care utilized after a trial period of chiropractic care (flexion distraction) or physical therapy (exercise program).
