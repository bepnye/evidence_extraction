Six peer groups ('IQual-groups') shall be randomised either to the intervention arm I or arm II. Groups of GDPs allocated to either of these arms act as each other's control group. An IQual peer group consists of eight to ten GDPs who meet in monthly structured sessions scheduled for discussion on practice-related topics. GDPs in both trial arms receive recently developed evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPG) on ROE or MIM. The implementation strategy consists of one interactive IQual group meeting of two to three hours.

These meetings discuss the selected intervention topic, and offer a more risk-based decision-making process guided by the CPG. Topics regarding risk management, such as identification of risk factors/indicators, preventive interventions, prognosis, monitoring, record keeping, and patient scheduling are presented. In addition, all participants receive feedback from personal and group characteristics retrieved from pre-test questionnaire and specific record forms, and are invited to make use of web-based patient risk vignettes for further individual training on risk assessment policy. These risk vignettes were developed by structured consensus procedures (modified Delphi) with expert groups consisted of acknowledged GDPs and oral surgeons in special fields. In addition, reminders (flow charts) and written patient leaflets with topical information are provided during the trial period. Flow charts comprise algorithms of decision-making aspects linked to the trial arm allocation.
