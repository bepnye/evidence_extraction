In the operating room practicum, 5 teams were designated as flipped learning groups, and the other 5 as traditional learning groups. The conditions were the same for the general surgical unit practicum. An independent statistician carried out the randomization using the SAS random number generator (SAS ver. 9.4 PROC PLAN; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). A random number was allocated to each of the 10 teams. The teams were placed in numerical order by the numbers allocated. Then, the independent statistician generated a random allocation sequence to designate the teams as either flipped earning group or traditional learning group. The 20 teams (n = 102) were randomly assigned (1:1) to either of the two groups; as a result, the number of students in each group was 51. After written consent had been received from all participants and the baseline survey had been administered, the randomization was completed. The students in each group were formally informed of their allocation to one of the learning styles and whether they were in the experimental or control group.

The time duration of exposure to the e-learning contents was longer for the flipped learning group than the traditional learning group because the e-learning activities of the flipped learning group started prior to the clinical practicum. This means that the flipped learning group was exposed to the e-learning objectives earlier than the traditional learning group. Because the flipped learning group already had the e-learning goals in their minds prior to attending the practicum classes, the flipped learning group may have been better focused on the course objectives during the limited class hours of the clinical practicum.

Flipped learning activities may increase student recognition of learning objectives through increased interaction with team members, curiosity and interest, and feedback-seeking behaviors to improve their academic performance. In addition, more opportunities for trial and error and clear feedback might have allowed the students in the flipped learning group to better recognize the e-learning objectives in comparison to the traditional learning group. The increased interaction and self-directed learning in the flipped learning group may have improved the cognitive understanding process, and it also might have encouraged the students to relate the current learning activity to positive thinking concerning their future goals.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26124" xml_f="26428" txt_i="19782" txt_f="20086">The flipped learning group improved their rational problem-solving skills and reconsidered their own assumptions and beliefs.

When encountering situations that conflict with one's established knowledge, reconsidering one's own assumptions and beliefs is important in developing relative thinking skills and knowledge by reasonably accepting others' thoughts. When there is a disagreement with others, through developing relative thinking skills, students may try to evaluate whether their thinking or judgment is correct. In clinical practicums, relative thinking skills are important because the situations and conditions of patients are complex and diverse, and nursing students must use their problem-solving skills for such complex cases. Students in the flipped learning group were better able to participate in team-based learning activities during the on-site instruction because they had already completed the pre-learning, which also allowed them to more actively participate in discussions during the on-site instruction. They shared their prior learning and problems in knowledge establishment with their peers and professor during the onsite instruction. Through the team-based learning activity, the students in the flipped learning group continued the self-evaluation process and might have modified their assumptions and beliefs. Specifically, during the question and answer period during the on-site instruction, the students found that clinical scenarios do not have one definite answer. Rather, there are several potential answers that require more integrated and critical thought. Therefore, it is possible that the flipped learning method is more suitable for this characteristic of clinical nursing practicums focused on case scenarios, as this method is superior in strengthening the cognitive e-learning process and skills such as critical thinking [</offsets><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="28251" xml_f="28253" txt_i="21838" txt_f="21840">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="28260" xml_f="28485" txt_i="21840" txt_f="22065">].

First, the nursing students were recruited from only one university. This means that its findings are not generalizable. Thus, future studies in different nursing courses and different settings should address this issue. Second, although our surgical nursing practicum course was planned based on the suggested nine rules of design for flipped learning, it is possible that there are diverse application points of the rules according to the characteristics of different courses. Focused activities in the flipped learning method might differ for various courses. Therefore, our study represents a trial for surgical nursing practicums, while other trials may be required for other nursing courses. Finally, the overall statistical significance was weak; therefore, more statistically robust findings from further randomized controlled trials are required to confirm the differences between the effects of the flipped learning and traditional learning methods for surgical nursing practicums.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="29979" xml_f="30740" txt_i="23469" txt_f="24230">In conclusion, this study suggested that the flipped learning method in surgical nursing practicums could offer more effective e-learning opportunities concerning the aspects of goal setting, accepting others' thoughts and modifying thinking, rational problem-solving skills, and deliberation in the e-learning process in comparison to the traditional learning method. Flipped learning in surgical nursing practicums could provide the benefits of allowing the sharing of prior learning and experienced problems for knowledge establishment due to prior learning and interactivity as well as prompt feedback through team-based learning. Together, these findings suggest that the application of the flipped learning method might differ for various nursing
