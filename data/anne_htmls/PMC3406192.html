Commonly, when serum PSA is increased or the DRE shows an unusual aspect, transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUS biopsy) is used to confirm the prostate cancer. In clinical practice, however, a significant number of negative biopsies are found according to these criteria. Generally, a negative biopsy rate of 76% can be expected [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="5903" xml_f="5904" txt_i="2089" txt_f="2090">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5911" xml_f="6627" txt_i="2090" txt_f="2806">]. Therefore, it is necessary to consider repeat prostate biopsy when patients have any clinical suspicion of prostate cancer, even if the initial prostate biopsy has a benign result. The economic burden and physical discomfort to the patient make it hard to decide whether to perform repeat biopsy. PSA, PSA density, and PSA velocity are commonly assessed to determine the necessity of repeat biopsy, but each of these tools has limitations to some extent. To overcome these limitations, many urologists are making an effort to find more reliable diagnostic tools that can be used to more accurately select patients who need repeat biopsy. Eventually, these efforts will lead to a reduction of unnecessary biopsies.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6634" xml_f="6659" txt_i="2807" txt_f="2832">According to Lin et al.

It may be hard to distinguish whether the prostate cancer detected at the repeat biopsy was newly developed after the first biopsy or whether undetected cancer from the first biopsy was discovered at the second biopsy. Also, our results have a limitation due to the small scale of the patient group. Accordingly, we need to identify a strict cut-off value of the PSA change ratio in a larger patient group. Another limitation of our study is that the PSA ratio was compared only at the first prostate biopsy.

According to the results of our study, it is recommended that doctors consider repeat prostate biopsy when the PSA change ratio is less than 3.0 to 4.0. The PSA change ratio could reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies; however, we cannot completely exclude prostate cancer even if the PSA change ratio is more than 3.0 to 4.0. Active follow-up is still necessary for patients who are clinically suspicious for prostate cancer. Further investigations with large-scale, multicenter studies are necessary to identify strict cut-off values of the PSA change ratio.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
