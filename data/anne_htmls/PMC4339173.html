fitness in soccer players. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-four soccer players were randomly
assigned to receive either rest (the control group) or three 30-minute sessions of Thai
massage over a period of 10 days. Seven physical fitness tests consisting of sit and
reach, hand grip strength, 40 yards technical agility, 50-meter sprint, sit-ups, push-ups,

Thai massage is well recognized and used to
enhance physical fitness for soccer players in Thailand. However, there is little scientific
evidence to support the suggestion that massage could enhance physical fitness in any
sports. Since soccer is one of the contact sports that requires players to have a variety of
physical fitness levels during competitions, we decided to investigate the acute effects of
Thai massage on physical fitness in soccer players.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title><offsets xml_i="7042" xml_f="7062" txt_i="2345" txt_f="2365">SUBJECTS AND METHODS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7073" xml_f="7829" txt_i="2366" txt_f="3122">A 10-day crossover design was used in the present study.

The test began by having the subjects sit on a cycle ergometer with an appropriate (at the
hip level in straight standing) seat height. They performed cycling exercise for one minute
without load following the tick of a metronome set at a speed of 50 rpm (or 18 km/h). After
that, the load was adjusted from 1–1.5 kp to achieve a heart rate response of around 120

massage using deeper pressure followed by passive stretching is applied along the massage
area, which covers all muscles having myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). Thai massage has
effects that breakdown any MTrPs adhesions. Since Thai Massage has been found to cause an
increase in muscle blood supply, it may allow the muscles to get more oxygen from the blood
and provide sufficient nutrients to the muscles. It causes the muscle to have more endurance
