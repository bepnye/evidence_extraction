Only nine percent of GCM activities focused on adherence to depression meds and 10% on depression med side effects; 12% included a PHQ9 evaluation. A comparison of medians indicated that from baseline to the 6 month point, those with at least one chronic condition reported to the GCM other than depression (N = 11) had more contacts in person, by phone, and indirectly (i.e., with someone other than the patient). These increased numbers of contacts were focused more often on core issues of depression and chronic conditions than on social issues. For the 19 patients the GCMs recorded 873 service episodes, an average of 46 episodes per patient; and 59% involved one of the 11 patients with chronic conditions.

Our experience demonstrates that training and deployment of GCMs into primary care practices is feasible and provides some guidance for further development and testing of this management strategy</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46520" xml_f="47460" txt_i="32225" txt_f="33165">In this small pilot study, we did not see relative benefits for the GCM arm for the primary clinical outcomes. We found similar improvement in both treatment arms for depression and functional status outcomes, except for a greater improvement in general mental health status for the UC group. The clinical meaning of this one difference is unclear. Possible explanations for the general lack of differences include insufficient statistical power (due to the small sample size), patient non-adherence with the more aggressive treatment recommendations in the GCM arm, and a high quality of usual care making the benefit of the GCM arm harder to identify. Clinicians were aware of the study and had patients in both arms of the protocol; it is certainly possible that for patients enrolled in UC, the providers were more vigilant than usual in monitoring depression care themselves, thus diminishing the difference between the two study arms.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47467" xml_f="48623" txt_i="33166" txt_f="34322">Another possibility is that GCM care for asthma and diabetes affected depressive symptoms. Seven (one third) of the patients in the UC group were receiving such services; the GCMs' presence in the lives of these patients may have been enough to improve their depressive symptoms or the GCMs may have encouraged these patients to follow the UC physicians' advice for depression, thus diluting the difference between the two study arms. Furthermore, poorly controlled asthma and diabetes can present with symptoms similar to depression such as fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbances. Care management that results in better asthma and diabetes control may improve these depressive symptoms. In addition, care managers working with asthmatic and diabetic patients focus on patients' knowledge of and correct use of glucometers and peak flow meters, and on the accurate recording of results. These patients may be more engaged in their medical and depression care than are patients without those medical illnesses. It seems possible that care management services for medical conditions could have improved depression outcomes in the UC group.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48630" xml_f="49166" txt_i="34323" txt_f="34859">On the other hand, eleven (50%) of the GCM group were receiving care management services for asthma and/or diabetes, and the GCM group appeared to have more self-reported comorbid illnesses than the UC group; the care managers may have limited their time devoted to depression care management to focus on these patients' other illnesses. Data from the GCM case records support this assertion. In addition, the overall poor physical health of this Medicaid population (2 standard deviations below the norm for physical functioning-Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"><offsets xml_i="49198" xml_f="49199" txt_i="34859" txt_f="34860">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49206" xml_f="49399" txt_i="34860" txt_f="35053">), the high rate of chronic pain (84%) reported, and the low self-efficacy (low score on "there are things I can do myself") present substantial impediments for GCMs and physicians to overcome.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="49406" xml_f="50034" txt_i="35054" txt_f="35682">Secondary outcomes, reflected by intermediate measures such as dosing of medications, were suggestive of benefit from use of GCMs. The results from a large number of tests, taken together, suggest that GCMs as compared to UC resulted in more written prescriptions of adequate medication dosages. Chi-square results were in this direction more often than would be expected by chance. This is more evident in the chart data than in the Medicaid and self-report data. This may indicate that GCMs influenced prescription writing by physicians more than they were able to influence prescription filling or medication use by patients.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="50041" xml_f="50736" txt_i="35683" txt_f="36378">Patient knowledge, attitudes, and satisfaction appear to have improved between the 3 month and 6 month follow-up points in both arms. It is not surprising that GCM patients with regular contact and education about these items had a better understanding of side effects than did UC patients at 3 months. However, the UC patients seem to have caught up by 6 months, perhaps as a result of education from their physicians and/or more time and experience with the medications. UC patients rated quality of care higher at 6 months than did GCM patients, a puzzling outcome that could represent some negative feelings in the GCM patients that physicians needed help from GCMs in order to provide care.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="50743" xml_f="51104" txt_i="36379" txt_f="36740">The GCM case notes illustrated the investment of time required, with an average of 46 interactions per patient.

The NC Medicaid program adapted our antidepressant medication dosing algorithm and the GCM training and care protocol for implementation into selected primary care practices. From July 2005 through June 2007 the NC Medicaid program is reimbursing practices for providing GCM services for depressed patients and will be monitoring service utilization data and PHQ-9 patient outcomes. GCMs appear to be a feasible intervention for community medical practices; however, given the many questions raised by our data, we believe that a larger scale trial is warranted to test the appropriateness for Medicaid programs nationally.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="52452" xml_f="52471" txt_i="37994" txt_f="38013">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="52482" xml_f="52542" txt_i="38014" txt_f="38074">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="52564" xml_f="52586" txt_i="38076" txt_f="38098">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="52597" xml_f="53205" txt_i="38099" txt_f="38707">SL contributed to the conception and design, acquisition of data, and interpretation of data.
