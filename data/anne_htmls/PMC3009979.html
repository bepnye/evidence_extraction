A prospective randomized controlled study was performed from July 2004 to December 2008 in one major tertiary care hospital, Nikaia's Regional General Hospital "Agios Panteleimon", in Athens Greece. All patients undergoing a cesarean delivery were eligible. Using a random-number generator (STATS version 1.1, 1998 program; Decision-Analyst Inc, Arlington, Tex), patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1.5 g of cefuroxime, or 3 g of ampicillin/sulbactam intravenously after the time the umbilical cord was clamped. The generation of the allocation sequence, the enrollment and the assignment of participants to their groups was performed by a physician dedicated to the study. The sequence was obtained using a central telephone number and it was concealed until interventions were assigned. Participants were enrolled sequentially and were blinded to the intervention, however the physician administering the intervention and assessing the outcomes was not. Patients with known hypersensivity to penicillin, cephalosporins, those who required concomitant antibiotic therapy or had received antibiotics during the 72 hours immediately preceding their enrollment, were excluded. Prior to the enrollment in the study, the medical history was taken and a physical examination was performed. Then the procedure was explained and discussed with each patient and written informed consent was obtained when a decision to proceed to a cesarean delivery was made. Preoperative vital signs including blood pressure, pulse rate, and temperature were also recorded. Blood samples were taken for complete blood counts with differential and blood chemistries. Concerning patients with diabetes mellitus, glycemic control was established preoperatively by close monitoring and insulin drips, if appropriate.

For example, presence of a microorganism in the genital tract besides infection can also be found in instances of colonization creating difficulty in clarifying the exact pathogenetic role in instances of infection. The monomicrobial nature of the culture results in all cases of infection in our study, may have limited such a bias. Furthermore, we had a significant number of emergency procedures due to the nature of our institution which is a tertiary care center with several referrals from suburban and regional hospitals. This may have created a selection bias for patients at a higher risk for infection. In fact over 30% of the population studied had a high ASA score. Another limitation is that the physician assessing outcomes was not blinded to the group assignments due to technical reasons and his participation as an assistant in the vast majority of the operations performed. Since the indicators of infection can be subjective it is possible that the observations may have been influenced by knowledge of the treatment group. However, accurate recording of several variables relating to the operation per se was achieved due to this fact. A third limitation is that we could not account for any residual confounding in our risk factor associations. A final limitation is the fact that the prophylaxis regimen was administered right after the time the umbilical cord was clamped according to standard obstetrical practice. However, a very recent position statement was published by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supporting a change in the current practice and recommending that the prophylaxis should be given 1 hour prior to the operation. Since our study was performed in the past we could not adhere to this guideline which will be implemented in the near future.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44440" xml_f="44451" txt_i="28334" txt_f="28345">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44462" xml_f="44851" txt_i="28346" txt_f="28735">In conclusion, we report for the first time in the literature a randomized comparison of ampicillin-sulbactam vs. cefuroxime as single dose prophylaxis in cesarean delivery. Our study demonstrated equal efficacy of the two regimens regarding prevention of postoperative infections after cesarean delivery. Both antibiotics were safe and well tolerated with no unusual or unexpected events.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44873" xml_f="44892" txt_i="28737" txt_f="28756">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44903" xml_f="44961" txt_i="28757" txt_f="28815">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44983" xml_f="45005" txt_i="28817" txt_f="28839">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="45016" xml_f="45239" txt_i="28840" txt_f="29063">EZ, KK, HG, conceived and designed the study, EZ performed the study, ST did the analysis and together with EZ prepared the first draft, all authors read, critically reviewed and approved the final draft of this manuscript.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="45261" xml_f="45284" txt_i="29065" txt_f="29088">Pre-publication history</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="45295" xml_f="45359" txt_i="29089" txt_f="29153">The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/341/prepub"><offsets xml_i="45462" xml_f="45514" txt_i="29154" txt_f="29206">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/10/341/prepub</offsets></ext-link></p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>No acknowledgements to declare.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Mangram</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Horan</surname><given-names>TC</given-names></name><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Silver</surname><given-names>LC</given-names></name><name><surname>Jarvis</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name><article-title>Guideline for prevention of surgical site infection, 1999.
