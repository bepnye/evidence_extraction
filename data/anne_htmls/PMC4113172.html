The goals of the ILS were to achieve and maintain a weight reduction of at least 7% of initial body weight through consumption of a low-calorie, low-fat diet and to engage in moderate physical activity for at least 150 min/week. Adherence to metformin was defined as taking ≥80% of assigned metformin and adherence to lifestyle as achieving the assigned weight loss of ≤7% of randomization weight.

The diagnosis required confirmation by a second test, usually within 6 weeks. Weight and glucose was assessed semiannually, while fasting insulin was assessed annually. The DPP study was stopped prematurely in May 2001 based on evidence of diabetes prevention in both active treatment groups, and an end of study (EOS) sample collection was conducted during a 6-month period from June through December 2001. At this time, participants entered a bridge period where interventions were unmasked and the lifestyle curriculum was offered in group sessions to the other treatment groups. CRP, tPA, and fibrinogen were measured at DPP baseline, at the first annual visit, and at EOS (median [25th–75th percentile] follow-up was 3.4 [2.8–4.0] years). CRP was also measured after 6 months. We excluded CRP, tPA, and fibrinogen measurements done after the initiation of the bridge (see below) to limit the analyses to the period of the DPP interventions. Since weight, glucose, and insulin measurements were obtained at protocol-specified annual visits that did not, for the most part, coincide with the EOS visits, these data were obtained from annual visits conducted within a 7-month period prior to or after the participant’s EOS visit. Using this approach, 91.4% of participants had weight, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin results available for analysis. These data together with the biomarker values obtained from samples collected at the end of the study visit are collectively referred to as the EOS results.

Weight loss in the ILS reached its nadir at 6 months through 1 year and then began to increase, though remaining significantly reduced from baseline at EOS. This pattern closely resembled the CRP response to the ILS intervention. Interestingly, CRP levels continued to fall from 6 to 12 months despite no further weight reduction after 6 months, suggesting that the benefit associated with ILS intervention or weight reduction on CRP levels extends beyond the period of active weight loss. The less robust initial CRP reduction in the metformin group at 1 year may be related to the smaller degree of weight loss achieved with this intervention, but the CRP reduction remained stable through the EOS in these participants as compared with that in the ILS group, which tended to attenuate. Some studies of metformin treatment have not noted an associated fall in CRP, and this may reflect the absence of significant weight loss in short-term studies (</offsets><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="56602" xml_f="56604" txt_i="23715" txt_f="23717">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="56611" xml_f="56871" txt_i="23717" txt_f="23977">).

This suggests that metformin may have long-term effects on CRP beyond weight reduction.

The similarities in response of tPA to the two interventions argues against weight reduction being the sole determinant of these changes since the amount of weight reduction in ILS was greater than with metformin. tPA remained significantly lower than the baseline values at EOS, suggesting that there was a persisting favorable change in coagulation balance in both active intervention groups.

One obvious explanation for this is that those who developed diabetes were less successful with the interventions than those who did not. This is likely the case for ILS, where the amount of weight reduction was shown to be inversely proportional to the incidence of diabetes (</offsets><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="59209" xml_f="59211" txt_i="26080" txt_f="26082">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="59218" xml_f="60001" txt_i="26082" txt_f="26865">). Because those who developed diabetes in the DPP did not on average lose weight, and since weight is a powerful determinant of CRP levels, this could explain why CRP did not fall with the ILS intervention over time in this subgroup. In support of this, when baseline and change in weight were entered into a model assessing the influence of diabetes development on time-related CRP changes in the ILS group, the effect of diabetes was completely accounted for. Furthermore we did not find evidence that developing diabetes in the placebo group was accompanied by an increase in CRP from baseline or that CRP was higher in those with diabetes versus without diabetes. This suggests that the major factor underlying subclinical inflammation in newly developed diabetes is overweight.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="60008" xml_f="60270" txt_i="26866" txt_f="27128">The diminished tPA response to ILS in the subgroup that developed diabetes was partly accounted for by weight and fasting insulin, in keeping with our previous observation that baseline tPA levels in DPP independently associate with each of these two variables (</offsets><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="60301" xml_f="60302" txt_i="27128" txt_f="27129">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="60309" xml_f="60694" txt_i="27129" txt_f="27514">). In the FDPS, the reduction in PAI-1 was largely accounted for by weight reduction.

However, the effect of metformin to reduce diabetes development in the DPP is also related to weight reduction and possibly to improvement in insulin sensitivity (</offsets><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="61308" xml_f="61310" txt_i="28051" txt_f="28053">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="61317" xml_f="61883" txt_i="28053" txt_f="28619">). Participants who developed diabetes in the metformin group were, however, of similar weight to those without diabetes, although fasting insulin levels were higher in those with diabetes. In the multivariate model, in contrast to the ILS group, weight only partly accounted for the lack of a time-related decrease in CRP in the metformin subgroup with diabetes, with insulin having no effect. Thus there remained a significant residual independent effect of diabetes development on the lack of a CRP response to metformin that was accounted for by fasting glucose.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="61890" xml_f="62617" txt_i="28620" txt_f="29347">The effect of diabetes development on change in tPA in the metformin group showed some similarities but also some differences from that in the ILS group. Weight and insulin each partly accounted for the attenuation in reduction of tPA levels related to incident diabetes and glucose explained most of the residual effect in the two groups. However, unlike in the placebo and lifestyle groups where tPA levels increased above baseline at the EOS, tPA levels were no different from baseline in the metformin group. Metformin appeared to prevent this progressive rise in tPA despite the development of diabetes. This may be related to its known effect to inhibit PAI-synthesis through a tumor necrosis factor-α–dependent pathway (</offsets><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="62649" xml_f="62651" txt_i="29347" txt_f="29349">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="62658" xml_f="62659" txt_i="29349" txt_f="29350">,</offsets><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="62691" xml_f="62693" txt_i="29350" txt_f="29352">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="62700" xml_f="62922" txt_i="29352" txt_f="29574">). We also considered whether the temporary 1-week discontinuation of metformin during the final 6-month sampling period to evaluate the effect of a metformin washout on diabetes development could have influenced results (</offsets><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="62953" xml_f="62954" txt_i="29574" txt_f="29575">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="62961" xml_f="63864" txt_i="29575" txt_f="30478">). It is possible that tPA levels may have increased during the metformin washout, but since this would have been transient, affected both those with and without diabetes, and constituted no more than a 5% fraction of the entire metformin cohort, the potential confounding was considered minimal. Similarly even though the 20 excess cases of diabetes directly attributable to the washout may have behaved aberrantly with respect to their effect on biomarkers, they represented less than 10% of cases with incident diabetes in the metformin group. Other limitations of the study as a whole include the fact that there were fewer participants at the end of the study than at the beginning and that the timing of sampling for the EOS biomarker measurements and that of the rest of the data collection could have been up to 7 months apart, although 89% of samples were collected halfway through that period.</offsets></p><p><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="63903" xml_f="63905" txt_i="30479" txt_f="30481">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="63912" xml_f="64453" txt_i="30481" txt_f="31022">), consistent with the appearance of dysfunctional fibrinolysis and enhanced cardiovascular risk early on in those progressing to diabetes. In this respect, tPA may be more closely linked to diabetes development than CRP, which is more strongly related to weight change. The effect of metformin treatment to prevent the increase of tPA noted in the other two subgroups with diabetes provides support for the use of metformin at the earliest stages of diabetes development, perhaps even if it is not able to prevent the emergence of diabetes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="64460" xml_f="65765" txt_i="31023" txt_f="32328">In summary, we show that in subjects with IGT receiving metformin or lifestyle interventions who do not develop diabetes, there are durable reductions in biomarkers of inflammation and coagulant imbalance. In contrast, those individuals who develop diabetes do not experience these apparently beneficial effects and may rapidly show unfavorable changes. Our analysis suggests that failure to lose weight among those who developed diabetes explains the lack of reduction of CRP. Lack of weight loss or failure of insulin sensitivity to improve were important but not sufficient explanations to account for the lack of reduction of tPA in those who progress to diabetes. This could mean that rising glucose levels per se or other associated metabolic factors could interfere with the beneficial effects of lifestyle or metformin interventions on tPA. It is also possible that subjects who develop diabetes may inherently not respond as well to these interventions. Whatever the explanation, the higher CRP or tPA levels in those who develop diabetes despite ILS or metformin intervention is consistent with the notion that ongoing inflammatory and procoagulant activities accompany diabetes development and that prevention of diabetes through lifestyle or metformin intervention ameliorates these processes.</offsets></p></sec><offsets xml_i="65775" xml_f="65776" txt_i="32330" txt_f="32331">
