Certain aspects of this trial design proved to be robust. Participant recruitment was relatively easy; the interactive nature of the Web site with an eligibility questionnaire reduced the burden on the investigators of screening applicants, and we were able to exceed our recruitment goal in a short period of time (6 months). Overall participant retention in the trial was high; 29 (91%) of participants completed the trial. In addition, the reduction in pain seen in the verum group compared to the placebo group lends support to the internal validity of this approach, as Zilexcontains benzocaine, an anesthetic shown to be effective in pain reduction [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8"><offsets xml_i="32685" xml_f="32686" txt_i="19855" txt_f="19856">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32693" xml_f="32694" txt_i="19856" txt_f="19857">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9"><offsets xml_i="32727" xml_f="32728" txt_i="19857" txt_f="19858">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32735" xml_f="32737" txt_i="19858" txt_f="19860">].</offsets></p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6"><offsets xml_i="32777" xml_f="32778" txt_i="19861" txt_f="19862">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32785" xml_f="33381" txt_i="19862" txt_f="20458">], there were a number of outbreaks for which it was difficult to assign a total duration due to missing data. Many of the missed visits occurred during weekends and holidays. This pattern indicates the possibility that many participants were accessing the trial Web site from work, and may not have had access to the Internet at home. Future trials of this nature may benefit by requiring participants to have Internet access at home. In addition, our trial participants did not receive any compensation. It is conceivable that some form of compensation might improve compliance in this respect.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33388" xml_f="33944" txt_i="20459" txt_f="21015">Another concern with the results of the trial was incomplete adherence to the study medication. It is unclear whether participants in a traditional clinic setting would have been more likely to use the study medication as directed. Poor adherence to study medication in clinical trials can have detrimental effects on the evaluation of safety and efficacy. On the other hand, the adherence rate found in this trial may be reflective of adherence to the medication in the general population and could, therefore, provide a valid evaluation of effectiveness.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33951" xml_f="34389" txt_i="21016" txt_f="21454">Limited generalizability may be a potential limitation of an Internet-based trial design. Our participants were Internet users and might not be representative of all individuals with cold sores. While this could theoretically influence the generalizability of our findings, it should not impair the validity. Of course, hospital-based or clinic-based trials face similar problems in that their participants are frequently highly selected.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="34396" xml_f="34690" txt_i="21455" txt_f="21749">One of the primary benefits of an Internet-based design for a clinical trial requiring frequent participant contact is the reduced burden on participants.

In particular, it appears that even with the reduced participant burden inherent in the Internet-based approach, the goals of daily online visits and adherence to an every-2-hours dosing schedule pose significant challenges. Based on our experiences, we make the following recommendations for future such trials: (1) mail a supply of (masked) active and placebo to each participant at enrolment, (2) randomize outbreaks rather than participants, (3) use the Internet as a portal enhanced by wireless PDAs for frequent data capture, (4) program the PDAs to perform a reminder function for medication adherence, and (5) consider providing an incentive.</offsets></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by Meditech Pharmaceuticals, Inc, PMB 382, 10105 E.
