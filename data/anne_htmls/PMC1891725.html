The trials were stopped early, and the investigators found that both estrogen alone, as well as estrogen plus progestin increased the risk of stroke amongst women participating in the trials. As part of a secondary analysis of data from these trials, the investigators aimed to explore possible associations between various biological markers (such as variants in particular genes, and levels of particular lipids, proteins, and other markers in blood), and the risk of a woman experiencing a stroke in the trials. Specifically, they wanted to evaluate whether there was any evidence for particular markers being associated with the risk of a stroke; and then whether that risk was modified by whether a woman took HT in the trials.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9726" xml_f="9727" txt_i="3128" txt_f="3129">

Two hundred five women who experienced a stroke were compared to 878 control individuals. The markers analyzed included those for which there was already some evidence for an association with stroke. Several clinical characteristics and some biomarkers, as measured at the start of the trial, but none of the gene variants, were linked with later risk of stroke. However, none of these clinical characteristics or gene variants specifically identified women who were at greater risk of experiencing a stroke within the HT arms of the trial. High levels of two biomarkers, IL-6 and PAP, did seem to identify women who were at lower risk of experiencing a stroke within the HT arms of the trial. This finding is interesting, because high levels of these markers had previously been suggested as being associated with a higher risk of stroke. Levels of several biomarkers changed during the trial, but for only one biomarker, D-dimer, did the change (an increase in levels) seem to predict higher risk of stroke amongst women receiving HT.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11106" xml_f="11107" txt_i="4489" txt_f="4490">

This design minimizes the chance that individuals taking HT differ in their stroke risk from individuals taking placebo. However, the power of this study to detect anything other than large associations is limited; together with the limitation of multiple statistical testing, the findings here must be interpreted as hypotheses for further study and not definitive conclusions.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11704" xml_f="11705" txt_i="5068" txt_f="5069">

All adjudicators were blinded to treatment assignment. Ischemic strokes were classified according to the Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Therapy (TOAST) and Oxfordshire subtype classifications. The TOAST stroke subtypes were as follows: large artery artherosclerosis (9%), cardioembolic (12%), small vessel occlusions (29%), other etiology (5%), and unknown etiology (45%). The Oxfordshire classifications were as follows: total anterior infarct (7%), partial anterior circulation infarct (40%), lacunar infarction (37%), and posterior circulation infarct (17%).</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title><offsets xml_i="18724" xml_f="18755" txt_i="9911" txt_f="9942">Genetic and biomarker analysis.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18766" xml_f="19200" txt_i="9943" txt_f="10377">Blood samples were collected from all participants at baseline and 1 y.

Some limitations should be considered. There were a relatively small number of strokes, confining us to detecting relatively large interactions of treatment with biomarkers. Because we analyzed a large number of biomarkers, some of the results may be due to chance. We studied clinical trial participants who may be different from the general population, so that the results might not be generalizable. A standardized diagnostic approach to stroke was not followed, and this may have led to misclassification of stroke types. Information on stroke subtype was limited. The fact that stroke risk was increased similarly with estrogen alone and estrogen plus progestin, whereas baseline levels of four biomarkers (IL-6, PAP, D-dimer, leukocyte count) appeared to predict a protective association from estrogen plus progestin, raises concerns about the plausibility of these findings.
