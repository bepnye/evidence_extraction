The LD group used two 2.8-mm-diameter tubes that contained 22 holes of 2.2 mm diameter at 10 cm intervals, and the SD group used two 1.6-mm-diameter tubes that contained 32 holes of 1.1 mm diameter at 10 cm intervals (</offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1"><offsets xml_i="9415" xml_f="9421" txt_i="4576" txt_f="4582">Fig. 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9428" xml_f="10819" txt_i="4582" txt_f="5973">).

Operations were performed according to the standard practice at the Seoul Sacred Heart General Hospital. Neither gelfoam nor any type of hemostatic material was used. Two drain tubes were placed over the laminectomy site in a parallel fashion as close as possible to the dura mater. Negative vacuum pressure was applied to drains within 8 minutes after the commencement of wound closure in all cases. Drains were removed and ambulation was allowed on day 3. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at day 7 postoperatively. To demonstrate the homogeneity of the two groups, data regarding demographics and blood coagulation parameters were compared. Total blood loss and blood loss per 10 minutes were also compared. The magnitude of any remaining hematoma was assessed by the degree of thecal sac compression on T2-weighted axial MRI which showed maximal compression.

The magnitude and complexity of spinal surgeries is becoming greater and estimated blood loss is increasing. Furthermore, antithrombotic treatment is performed more frequently. Previous studies have focused on the incidence and risk factors; however, there is as yet is no consensus regarding the risk factors for POSEH. According to retrospective case studies, significantly increased risk has been reported in patients over 60 years old, with Rh-positive blood types, intraoperative hemoglobin values &lt; 10 g/dL, and international normalized ratio (INR) values &gt; 2.0 within the first 48 hours postoperatively.</offsets><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="14784" xml_f="14786" txt_i="9521" txt_f="9523">1)</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14793" xml_f="14901" txt_i="9523" txt_f="9631"> Multilevel procedures and preoperative coagulopathy significantly increase the risk of symptom development,</offsets><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="14932" xml_f="14934" txt_i="9631" txt_f="9633">2)</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14941" xml_f="15093" txt_i="9633" txt_f="9785"> and preoperative nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and large intraoperative blood loss volumes were reported to be significant predisposing factors.</offsets><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="15124" xml_f="15126" txt_i="9785" txt_f="9787">4)</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15133" xml_f="15275" txt_i="9787" txt_f="9929"> In a prospective study in asymptomatic patients, a larger volume of hematoma was associated with advanced age, multilevel procedure, and INR.</offsets><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="15307" xml_f="15310" txt_i="9929" txt_f="9932">15)</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15317" xml_f="15378" txt_i="9932" txt_f="9993"> Because symptomatic POSEH develops in 0.1% to 0.2% of cases,</offsets><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="15409" xml_f="15410" txt_i="9993" txt_f="9994">1</offsets></xref><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="15448" xml_f="15449" txt_i="9994" txt_f="9995">2</offsets></xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="15487" xml_f="15488" txt_i="9995" txt_f="9996">3</offsets></xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="15526" xml_f="15528" txt_i="9996" txt_f="9998">4)</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15535" xml_f="15726" txt_i="9998" txt_f="10189"> performing a randomized prospective study of the risk factors of symptomatic cases is nearly impossible.

Other than the size of a drain tube, blood viscosity and drain tube position could affect the results. We thought that drain tubes should be placed as close as possible to the dura mater so as not to allow a hematoma mass close to the thecal sac. Moreover, vacuum should be connected before clotting of extravascular blood. Any materials that can activate platelet and facilitate coagulation of extravascular blood were avoided to prevent dysfunction of suction drains. However, there was no difference in the size of remaining hematoma between the two groups. In other words, a SD was sufficient to evacuate the remaining blood. However, symptomatic POSEHs developed in the LD group.

We performed a hematoma evacuation under local anesthesia to demonstrate its contribution to the symptoms. The leg pain began to improve immediately after removal of the hematoma in all three patients. We expected a greater number of POSEH cases with mild-to-moderate symptoms. We were unsure whether this type of POSEH would have neurological sequelae or resolve spontaneously. However, many undiscovered cases are likely extant.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19748" xml_f="20234" txt_i="13954" txt_f="14440">There were several limitations to our study.
