They observed significantly lower rate of OHSS in the antagonist group. Similarly, we found lower rate of OHSS in the antagonist group, but it was not statistically significant. This difference may be related to the stimulation regimen. Using different medication or different treatment regimens may lead to different results.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7"><offsets xml_i="15269" xml_f="15270" txt_i="9236" txt_f="9237">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="15277" xml_f="15351" txt_i="9237" txt_f="9311">] Aforementioned studies administered Ganirelix, while we used Cetrorelix.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="15358" xml_f="15597" txt_i="9312" txt_f="9551">It is believed that GnRH antagonists usually do not induce cyst formation or stimulate gonadotropins and steroid hormones acutely which is more prevalent in the initial stimulation by GnRH agonists.

LH instability means any fluctuation in the LH level such as LH surge or rise in the LH concentration.

These controversies are mostly due to difference in the study design. Given the above evidence, we may conclude that administration of GnRH antagonists in ovarian stimulation will be a reasonable option which is at least as effective and safe as GnRH agonists. Moreover, less need for gonadotropin consumption decreases the procedure cost and adverse effects. However, in order to overcome the controversies, further studies with larger sample size are needed to investigate and compare different treatment protocols.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></fn><fn
