Candidate depth of anesthesia monitors have been developed, partly with the aim of preventing this complication. Despite conflicting results from clinical trials and the lack of incisive validation, such monitors have enjoyed widespread clinical adoption, in particular the bispectral index. The American Society of Anesthesiologists has called for adequately powered and rigorously designed clinical trials to determine whether the use of such monitors decreases the incidence of awareness in various settings. The aim of this study is to determine with increased precision whether incorporating the bispectral index into a structured general anesthesia protocol decreases the incidence of awareness with explicit recall among a subset of surgical patients at increased risk for awareness and scheduled to receive an inhalation gas-based general anesthetic.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="5323" xml_f="5337" txt_i="1026" txt_f="1040">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5348" xml_f="6133" txt_i="1041" txt_f="1826">BAG-RECALL is a multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial, in which 6,000 patients are being assigned to bispectral index-guided anesthesia (target range, 40 to 60) or end-tidal anesthetic gas-guided anesthesia (target range, 0.7 to 1.3 age-adjusted minimum alveolar concentration).

The null hypothesis of the BAG-RECALL trial is that the BIS-guided protocol will not decrease AWR compared with the ETAG-guided protocol in this population. The alternative hypothesis, for which the study is powered, is that the BIS monitor confers a clinically significant advantage in decreasing AWR, independent of the protocol-based care. We based our projected estimates of AWR incidence among higher risk patients on the results of the B-Aware and the B-Unaware trials. With an incidence of AWR of 0.5% (5 in a 1,000) in the ETAG group and 0.1% (1 in a 1,000) in the BIS group, 3,000 patients in each group would be sufficient to detect this difference with a one-tailed alpha of 0.05 using Fisher's exact test (power = 87%). This represents an absolute risk reduction of 0.4% and a number needed to treat of 250 patients at higher risk for AWR. Any lesser absolute risk reduction would probably be clinically unimportant and not cost effective with the present cost of disposable BIS electrodes. We will also use a one-sided Fisher's exact test to determine if the BIS-guided group has a lower incidence of definite and possible AWR. Confidence intervals for absolute risk reduction will be calculated with the use of Newcombe's method without continuity correction. There will be no interim analysis. Chi-Squared, Fisher's exact, unpaired Mann-Whitney, and unpaired t-tests will be used as appropriate for other comparisons between the groups, including patient characteristics and secondary outcomes. Intention-to-treat analysis is planned. A multivariable regression model will be used to evaluate the independent association of specific variables with AWR and secondary outcomes. Agreement among experts assessing AWR will be assessed using a two-way random effects intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficient for absolute agreement using the metric: no = 0, maybe = 1, yes = 2. Apart from assessment of AWR, all other significance testing will be two-sided and a P value less than 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="24955" xml_f="24965" txt_i="18730" txt_f="18740">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="24976" xml_f="25056" txt_i="18741" txt_f="18821">This trial has been designed to complement two other clinical trials: B-Unaware[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="25088" xml_f="25090" txt_i="18821" txt_f="18823">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25097" xml_f="25466" txt_i="18823" txt_f="19192">] (NCT00281489) and MACS (NCT00689091). With the large patient numbers and complementary rigorous designs, it is envisaged that pre-specified meta-analyses will address some of the outstanding controversies and questions relating to the potential usefulness of processed EEG monitors in relation to preventing AWR and in relation to other clinically important outcomes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25473" xml_f="26688" txt_i="19193" txt_f="20408">Some important issues will remain unaddressed by BAG-RECALL, such as: 1) Are processed EEG monitors, such as BIS, useful in the setting of total intravenous anesthesia? 2) Is BIS the most useful processed EEG monitoring technique? 3) Do processed EEG monitors increase the likelihood of AWR if they are used specifically to minimize anesthetic dose? 4) What impact does the BIS protocol have in settings other than the one in which this trial is being conducted? 5) Are processed EEGs cost effective if used routinely for all patients requiring general anesthesia? 6) Does the use of nitrous oxide impact the likelihood of AWR? As BAG-RECALL is enrolling only patients who are considered to be at higher risk for AWR, and who are undergoing general anesthesia with a potent inhalation agent, the results may not be generalized beyond this patient population. If the BIS protocol is associated with a reduction in AWR, it does not rule out the possibility that it would be associated with no reduction or even an increased incidence of AWR in other patient populations. This emphasizes the importance of our companion trial, MACS (NCT00689091), which is enrolling all surgical patients, regardless of perceived risk.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="26695" xml_f="27557" txt_i="20409" txt_f="21271">An important assumption underlying the design of the BAG-RECALL trial is that risk factors for AWR are known and patients with increased risk can be identified and enrolled. However, if there are unidentified risk factors for AWR, such as genetic resistance to the hypnotic or amnestic actions of anesthetic agents, and if these are relatively common compared with the risk factors that have been used to identify eligible patients for BAG-RECALL, this could be an important hidden confounder. If the unidentified risk factors are distributed unequally between the BIS and ETAG groups, this could confound the results of the trial independent of the BIS and ETAG protocols. With rare risk factors and an even rarer outcome (i.e., AWR), it is not certain that randomization alone will result in equal assignment of patients with hidden risk factors to each group.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="27564" xml_f="28037" txt_i="21272" txt_f="21745">One of the most important reasons to prevent AWR is to prevent long-term psychological symptoms and the development of PTSD. While assessing psychological consequences is an important secondary outcome of BAG-RECALL, it may not be valid to apply the results of BAG-RECALL to patients who suffer AWR in general. The reason for this is that all patients who experience AWR are referred to an expert counselor whose intervention may mitigate the psychological sequelae of AWR.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28044" xml_f="28723" txt_i="21746" txt_f="22425">A criticism leveled against the B-Unaware trial was that the control group also used a protocol, which was not reflective of current standard practice. For the B-Unaware, the BAG RECALL, and MACS clinical trials, we have designed protocols that are simple and easy to implement at no cost over current practice. We have stressed that the protocols are not intended to be restrictive, but are merely intended to increase vigilance and possibly to provide earlier warning when awareness is more likely to occur. If processed EEG monitors, such as the BIS, are to enjoy widespread adoption, they must confer advantage over the best, simple alternative practice, not just usual care.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28745" xml_f="28764" txt_i="22427" txt_f="22446">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28775" xml_f="28900" txt_i="22447" txt_f="22572">The authors have no financial or non-financial competing interests to declare.
