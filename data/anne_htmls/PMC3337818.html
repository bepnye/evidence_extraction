recommended by the World Health Organization based on evidence that it reduces mortality. There has been considerable interest in determining the benefits of neonatal vitamin A supplementation, but the results of existing trials are conflicting. A technical consultation convened by WHO pointed to the need for larger scale studies in Asia and Africa to inform global policy on the use of neonatal vitamin A supplementation. Three trials were therefore initiated in Ghana, India and Tanzania to determine if vitamin A supplementation (50,000 IU) given to neonates once orally on the day of birth or within the next two days will reduce mortality in the period from supplementation to 6 months of age compared to placebo.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8375" xml_f="8389" txt_i="810" txt_f="824">Methods/Design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8400" xml_f="9507" txt_i="825" txt_f="1932">The trials are individually randomized, double masked, and placebo controlled.

Neonates randomized to the intervention group receive 50,000 IU vitamin A and the ones randomized to the control group receive placebo at the time of enrolment. Mortality and morbidity information are collected through periodic home visits by a study worker during infancy. The primary outcome of the study is mortality from supplementation to 6 months of age. The secondary outcome of the study is mortality from supplementation to 12 months of age. The three studies will be analysed independent of each other.

The study participants are neonates who are likely to stay in the study areas until at least 6 months of age, who are able to feed orally at the time of enrolment and whose parents provide written informed consent for study participation. Neonates randomized to the intervention group receive 50,000 IU vitamin A on the day of birth or in the next two days, and those randomized to the control group receive placebo. Potential adverse events are determined during visits by a study worker one day and three days after supplementation. A potential adverse event is defined as any harmful and/or undesired effect as reported by the family which may have resulted from the use of the vitamin A supplement. These include presence of bulging fontanelle, vomiting, fever, diarrhoea, inability to suck or feed, and convulsions.
