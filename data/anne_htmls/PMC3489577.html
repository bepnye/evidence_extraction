Oatmeal (Quaker Instant Oatmeal produced by PepsiCo Foods (China) co., Ltd.) was packaged in 200g (dry wt) packages and 4 packages were provided to participants one week followed by 3 packages the next week. Participants receiving the oatmeal were instructed to prepare ½ a package (~100g dry wt, providing approximately 3.6g soluble fiber) each day according to the on-pack preparation instructions (with hot water or milk). Consumption of the prepared amount could be split across two or three meals each day for the six week intervention period. Wheat noodles (“Shengchu” brand processed wheat flour based noodles) were purchased in 450g packages at the local grocery store and distributed to participants on a weekly basis. Participants were instructed to prepare and consume 100g (dry wt) each day. All subjects in the control group were shown a 100g portion of dry noodles that had been weighed on a scale to help them visualize the amount that they should prepare and consume each day. Wheat based noodles are a standard staple in the diets of this population and this amount can easily be consumed in one meal. Each participant was asked to record the quantity of the test food they consumed each day.
