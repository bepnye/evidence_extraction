A person's functioning and disability is described as a dynamic interaction between health conditions and contextual, environmental and personal factors. Health conditions encompass disease, disorders, injuries and traumas. Contextual, environmental and personal factors describe the psychosocial elements of a person's life [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60"><offsets xml_i="44984" xml_f="44986" txt_i="33006" txt_f="33008">60</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="44993" xml_f="45064" txt_i="33008" txt_f="33079">].

The reductionist thinking associated with this model may be the cause of the inherent problems associated with the current treatment. As the biopsychosocial model gains credibility, it seems plausible that there may be a place for this paradigm in the management of hypothyroidism. If this disease were to be approached from a more wholistic standpoint, solutions to current management problems may be revealed. It is also feasible that if this disease were approached using a different model, factors in addition to pure biological influences may be discovered. Research into thyroid hormones and mood disorders further highlights the need for investigation in this area. A framework such as the biopsychosocial model seems to be a plausible model of inquiry.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="46025" xml_f="46035" txt_i="34014" txt_f="34024">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="46046" xml_f="46508" txt_i="34025" txt_f="34487">The biopsychosocial model represents the latest ideas in chronic illness management and compliments recent ideas in pain theory. It states that in order to rationalise and contend with chronic conditions, one must take into account the influence of biological, psychological and social factors. The biopsychosocial model is gaining acceptance within educational institutions and medical fields and is proving very successful in the areas in which it is applied [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="46539" xml_f="46540" txt_i="34487" txt_f="34488">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46547" xml_f="47080" txt_i="34488" txt_f="35021">]. Hypothyroidism is one chronic condition that may benefit from the application of the biopsychosocial model. Application of biopsychosocial-based interventions/therapies may help mediate some of the signs and symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. If nothing else this model represents an adjunctive framework that may facilitate a more consistent management of this chronic disease.The authors plan a randomised control trial that will seek to investigate the effect of a biopsychosocial-based treatment regime on hypothyroidism</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="47102" xml_f="47124" txt_i="35023" txt_f="35045">Authors' Contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47135" xml_f="47246" txt_i="35046" txt_f="35157">BTB wrote the manuscript.
