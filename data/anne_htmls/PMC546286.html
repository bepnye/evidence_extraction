This report is the first to show that HRT resulted in reduction of markers of both bone and cartilage turnover in women with RA. We also wanted to evaluate associations between the markers and bone mass and the Larsen score at baseline and to see if the changes in markers could predict BMD and joint destruction. There were significant correlations between several biochemical markers and bone mass and radiological status at entry into the study. Additionally, decreases in markers of bone metabolism were associated with improved bone mass.

The decrease in bone turnover markers CTX-I, ICTP, and PICP were associated with improved bone mass after 2 years, with CTX-I providing the most sensitive prognostic value. Baseline measures of ICTP and the markers of cartilage turnover, CTX-II and COMP, were correlated with the Larsen score and decreased during HRT treatment. Thus, specific biochemical markers of bone and cartilage turnover may be useful for assessing novel treatment modalities in arthritis, concerning both joint protection and prevention of osteoporosis.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="45197" xml_f="45216" txt_i="34671" txt_f="34690">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="45227" xml_f="45332" txt_i="34691" txt_f="34796">Tore Saxne is a shareholder in AnaMar Medical and Stephan Christgau is employed by Nordic Bioscience A/S.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="45354" xml_f="45367" txt_i="34798" txt_f="34811">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="45378" xml_f="45646" txt_i="34812" txt_f="35080">BMD = bone mineral density; BSP = bone sialoprotein; COMP = cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; CTX-I = C-terminal telopeptide fragments of type I collagen; CTX-II = C-terminal telopeptide fragments of type II collagen; DMARD = disease-modifying antirheumatic drug; E</offsets><sub><offsets xml_i="45651" xml_f="45653" txt_i="35080" txt_f="35082">2 </offsets></sub><offsets xml_i="45659" xml_f="45916" txt_i="35082" txt_f="35339">= estradiol; ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; HRT = hormone replacement therapy; ICTP = C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen; PICP = C-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen; RA = rheumatoid arthritis.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Supported by grants from Regional Research Sources from Västra Götaland, Novo Nordisk Research Foundation, Rune och Ulla Amlövs foundation for Rheumatology Research, The Research Foundation of Trygg-Hansa, the Swedish and Göteborg Association against Rheumatism, Reumaforskningsfond Margareta, King Gustav V:s 80-years Foundation, The Medical Society of Göteborg, and the Medical Faculty of Göteborg (LUA).
