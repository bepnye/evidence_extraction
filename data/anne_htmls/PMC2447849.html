The results therefore should be replicated in a wider variety of settings. However, the poor response rate (47%) makes it impossible to be sure whether randomisation ensured comparability between the groups at baseline, though for the recorded baseline variables the two groups were comparable. The response rate and age difference of non-responders was consistent with other similar postal questionnaires [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32"><offsets xml_i="38434" xml_f="38436" txt_i="23759" txt_f="23761">32</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38443" xml_f="38444" txt_i="23761" txt_f="23762">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"><offsets xml_i="38476" xml_f="38478" txt_i="23762" txt_f="23764">33</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="38485" xml_f="40134" txt_i="23764" txt_f="25413">]. However it may be necessary to explore other more intensive modes of administration to see if responses to questions requesting similar information are significantly different. Twenty statistical tests were performed on secondary outcomes in this study, as it was not powered for these analyses one false positive result would be expected and we made no correction for multiple testing. Therefore our significant findings should be considered exploratory. The patients' ability to identify the survey recipient may have been decreased by ethical requirements to enclose a covering letter from the medical practice. This letter was on practice headed paper and asked patients to read the enclosed information regarding a research project. To determine the true extent of response differences the ideal research design would have been a factorial design involving four cells (sent by practice returned to practice; sent by practice returned to independent researcher; sent by independent researcher returned to practice; sent by independent researcher returned to independent researcher). However, this design is not possible with current ethical and data protection concerns, hence the pragmatic nature of our design. Additional qualitative analysis would have helped to determine the significance of the covering letter and explore reasons for specific responses. As a randomised controlled trial it was hoped that this study would be able to detect genuine differences in responses between respondents that were not a result of different settings which is a general limitation of much of the literature on modes of questionnaire administration [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><offsets xml_i="40166" xml_f="40168" txt_i="25413" txt_f="25415">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40175" xml_f="40285" txt_i="25415" txt_f="25525">].

Assuming the groups were comparable at baseline it therefore supports the validity of returning existing patient satisfaction questionnaires used in the current GMS contract to the patients' medical practice. Our secondary findings led us to the hypothesis that if questionnaires are extended to explore more detailed experiences of consultations and patient behaviours, responses may be subject to additional response bias. In our case we believe social desirability bias to be responsible for the differences observed and any method able to reduce this phenomena with behavioural questions is of benefit to future questionnaires [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"><offsets xml_i="41091" xml_f="41093" txt_i="26264" txt_f="26266">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="41100" xml_f="41102" txt_i="26266" txt_f="26268">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41109" xml_f="41541" txt_i="26269" txt_f="26701">In the future research should compare questionnaire response to measurable outcomes where possible to help determine the accuracy of responses.
