Quitting smoking is particularly difficult for smokers with certain types of psychological vulnerability. Researchers have frequently called attention to the relation between smoking and anxiety-related states and disorders, and evidence suggests that panic and related anxiety vulnerability factors, specifically anxiety sensitivity (AS or fear of somatic arousal), negatively impact cessation. Accordingly, there is merit to targeting AS among smokers to improve cessation outcome. Aerobic exercise has emerged as a promising aid for smoking cessation for this high-risk (for relapse) group because exercise can effectively reduce AS and other factors predicting smoking relapse (for example, withdrawal, depressed mood, anxiety), and it has shown initial efficacy for smoking cessation. The current manuscript presents the rationale, study design and procedures, 
and design considerations of the Smoking Termination Enhancement Project (STEP).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6317" xml_f="6324" txt_i="1118" txt_f="1125">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6335" xml_f="7347" txt_i="1126" txt_f="2138">STEP is a randomized clinical trial that compares a vigorous-intensity exercise intervention to a health and wellness education intervention as an aid for smoking cessation in adults with elevated AS. One hundred and fifty eligible participants will receive standard treatment (ST) for smoking cessation that includes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). In addition, participants will be randomly assigned to either an exercise intervention (ST+EX) or a health and wellness education intervention (ST+CTRL). Participants in both arms will meet 3 times a week for 15 weeks, receiving CBT once a week for the first 7 weeks, and 3 supervised exercise or health and wellness education sessions (depending on randomization) per week for the full 15-week intervention. Participants will be asked to set a quit date for 6 weeks after the baseline visit, and smoking cessation outcomes as well as putative mediator variables will be measured up to 6 months following the quit date.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7369" xml_f="7379" txt_i="2140" txt_f="2150">Discussion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7390" xml_f="8081" txt_i="2151" txt_f="2842">The primary objective of STEP is to evaluate whether vigorous-intensity exercise can aid smoking cessation in anxiety vulnerable adults. If effective, the use of vigorous-intensity exercise as a component of smoking cessation interventions would have a significant public health impact. Specifically, in addition to improving smoking cessation treatment outcome, exercise is expected to offer benefits to overall health, which may be particularly important for smokers. The study is also designed to test putative mediators of the intervention effects and therefore has the potential to advance the understanding of exercise-anxiety-smoking relations and guide future research on this topic.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8103" xml_f="8127" txt_i="2844" txt_f="2868">Clinical trials registry</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8138" xml_f="8171" txt_i="2869" txt_f="2902">ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01065506, </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01065506"><offsets xml_i="8261" xml_f="8307" txt_i="2902" txt_f="2948">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01065506</offsets></ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Smoking</kwd><kwd>Smoking cessation</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Aerobic exercise</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Anxiety sensitivity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8604" xml_f="8614" txt_i="2957" txt_f="2967">Background</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="8634" xml_f="8663" txt_i="2968" txt_f="2997">Tobacco use: scope of problem</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8674" xml_f="8794" txt_i="2998" txt_f="3118">Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of death in the United States (US), contributing to over 440,000 deaths each year [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="8825" xml_f="8826" txt_i="3118" txt_f="3119">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8833" xml_f="8962" txt_i="3119" txt_f="3248">].

They gradually taper to a lower dose of the patch every 2 weeks. All participants are asked to taper off the lowest dose of the patch by week 14, at which time the patch is no longer provided. At each session while using the patch, participants are asked about current side effects they may be experiencing. Again, participants can also elect not to use the patch.

Specifically, during the first session, participants receive a thorough description of the wellness program along with a rationale for the intervention.

They are also advised that focusing on small wellness goals each week and gaining small successes may carry over into their smoking cessation goals. Wellness education sessions focus on discussions of a variety of healthy lifestyle topics, such as healthy eating, stress and time management, recommended health screenings, and cancer and cardiovascular prevention.

The Cornell protocol is similar to the Bruce protocol; however, the Cornell protocol is divided into smaller and shorter stages and is generally more applicable to patients with limited exercise tolerance because of the smaller workload increments. Prior to the test, a resting ECG is taken and resting HR and blood pressure are measured. Participants then exercise at a rate that gradually increases in speed and incline in 2-min intervals for a maximum of 14 min. Participants are instructed that they may stop exercising at any point, but are encouraged to continue until they reach their maximal exercise dose. Maximal exercise is defined as an inability to continue exercise despite vigorous encouragement.

If effective, the use of exercise as a component of treatment for smoking cessation would have a significant public health impact. In addition to improving smoking cessation treatment outcome, exercise is expected to offer benefits to overall health, which may be particularly important for smokers. Further, the proposed study (that is, design, assessment schedule, and analyses) offers the potential to improve the understanding of the mechanisms that underlie these effects. The specific design considerations of the exercise intervention provide a dose and intensity that is thought to enact beneficial biological and psychological changes while also allowing for participant satisfaction and flexibility. The utilization of a wellness education group provides an adequate, time-matched control necessary in order to examine the specific effects of exercise.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="75432" xml_f="76114" txt_i="49153" txt_f="49835">The anticipated benefits of the study are twofold: (1) the results will yield knowledge about the combined effects of exercise with standard smoking cessation treatment; and (2) the results will advance understanding of the factors related to anxiety and relapse to smoking after attempts at smoking cessation. The results of the study may also inform strategies to match treatments to specific characteristics of smokers. Lastly, data yielded by this study is expected to guide future studies that aim to determine the optimal dose and intensity for exercise-based smoking cessation interventions as well strategies to enhance motivation to exercise and motivation to quit smoking.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="76130" xml_f="76142" txt_i="49836" txt_f="49848">Trial status</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="76153" xml_f="76201" txt_i="49849" txt_f="49897">The trial is currently in the recruitment phase.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="76229" xml_f="76242" txt_i="49900" txt_f="49913">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="76253" xml_f="76626" txt_i="49914" txt_f="50287">ACSM: American College of Sports Medicine; AS: Anxiety sensitivity; CBT: Cognitive behavioral therapy; NRT: Nicotine replacement therapy; PPA: Point prevalence abstinence; ST: Standard treatment; ST+CTRL: Standard treatment plus control condition; ST+EX: Standard treatment plus exercise condition; STEP: Smoking Termination Enhancement Project; TLFB: Timeline follow back.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="76648" xml_f="76667" txt_i="50289" txt_f="50308">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="76678" xml_f="76862" txt_i="50309" txt_f="50493">Drs Smits and Otto receive royalties from Oxford University Press for books on exercise for mood and anxiety disorders.
