This randomised control study recruited 66 subjects with indwelling urinary catheters after undergoing CRC surgery who later underwent catheter removal. Patients inhaled 1% lavender, 1% linalyl acetate, or vehicle (control group) for 20 minutes. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate, LUTS, and visual analog scales of pain magnitude and quality of life (QoL) regarding urinary symptoms were measured before and after inhalation. Systolic BP, diastolic BP, heart rate, LUTS, and QoL satisfaction with urinary symptoms were similar in the three groups. Significant differences in pain magnitude and urinary residual sense of indwelling catheters were observed among the three groups, with inhalation of linalyl acetate being significantly more effective than inhalation of lavender or vehicle.

At present, CRC is the third most common cancer in both men and women, with 27,618 patients newly diagnosed with CRC in 2013, accounting for 12.3% of the 225,343 patients newly diagnosed with cancer during that year [</offsets><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="5050" xml_f="5051" txt_i="1754" txt_f="1755">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5058" xml_f="5470" txt_i="1755" txt_f="2167">]. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for CRC, but it entails various side effects and complications. The most frequent postoperative complications include micturition disorders, ileus, changes in bowel habit, postoperative pain, enterostomy related problems, surgical site infection and bleeding, anastomotic leakage, and pulmonary complications, all of which can lead to physical pain and distress [</offsets><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="5501" xml_f="5502" txt_i="2167" txt_f="2168">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5509" xml_f="5737" txt_i="2168" txt_f="2396">]. Post-CRC pain is both sharp and acute, adding to overall malaise and fatigue. Micturition disorders resulting from CRC surgery have been attributed to injuries to the iliohypogastric and/or pelvic splanchnic nervous systems [</offsets><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="5768" xml_f="5769" txt_i="2396" txt_f="2397">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5776" xml_f="6267" txt_i="2397" txt_f="2888">]. The intrapelvic autonomic nervous system involved in the neural control of micturition includes the pelvic splanchnic and iliohypogastric nerves and the pelvic nervous plexus. The hypogastric nerves, which arise from the preaortic sympathetic plexus, divide to the left and right within the pelvis, forming the pelvic autonomic nerve plexus upon meeting the parasympathetic sacral splanchnic nerves that originate from the second, third, and fourth sacral foramina along the pelvic wall [</offsets><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6298" xml_f="6299" txt_i="2888" txt_f="2889">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6306" xml_f="6735" txt_i="2889" txt_f="3318">]. Therefore, any injury to the pelvic splanchnic or iliohypogastric nervous system causes a dysfunction in micturition. Injury to the parasympathetic nervous circuitry causes the sensory function of the bladder to deteriorate, increases voiding difficulty, and weakens detrusor contraction, whereas injury to the sympathetic nervous circuitry causes urinary urgency, tonic urinary incontinence, and increased urinary frequency [</offsets><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="6766" xml_f="6767" txt_i="3318" txt_f="3319">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6774" xml_f="7053" txt_i="3319" txt_f="3598">]. The main neurogenic causes of micturition disorders resulting from CRC surgery may be intraoperative injuries to the ureter or pelvic autonomic nervous system.

Typical types of pain relief management after CRC surgery include patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA), narcotic (opioid) analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and epidural anesthesia [</offsets><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7666" xml_f="7667" txt_i="4136" txt_f="4137">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7674" xml_f="8321" txt_i="4137" txt_f="4784">]. Despite pharmacotherapy, however, many patients complain of severe pain in the area of surgery. Acute micturition disorders after CRC surgery impede return to the activities of daily life. Moreover, lower urinary tract symptoms arising from voiding difficulty degrade patient quality of life (QoL) and aggravate patient discomfort until the recovery of urinary function. To prevent this, CRC surgery, consisting of total mesorectal excision, is designed to preserve pelvic autonomic function; indeed, it was found that such autonomic nerve-preserving total mesorectal excision prevents local recurrence as well as preserving urinary functions [</offsets><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8352" xml_f="8353" txt_i="4784" txt_f="4785">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8360" xml_f="8362" txt_i="4785" txt_f="4787">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8369" xml_f="8509" txt_i="4788" txt_f="4928">Aromatherapy, defined as inhalation of herb oil essences, is a type of complementary and alternative therapy.
