The allocation sequence was generated by one of the co-investigators (HT) who was not involved in subject recruitment, drug administration or outcome assessment. The administration of acetaminophen or placebo four hours after baseline was chosen to coincide with the expected time of maximum antipyresis of ibuprofen, after which there is gradual waning of this effect.

The purpose and procedure of the trial were fully explained to the family, and written parental consent was obtained, together with the assent of the subject if older than ten years. Children enrolled in the study were then assigned a random number by the hospital pharmacist according to a computer-generated random-number list, which was kept with the pharmacist until the end of the study.

In order to eliminate bias that could be caused by baseline temperature, the variable chosen for analysis was the change in temperature, from baseline, at times t (t = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8). Additional testing with logistic regression was performed to investigate the association between the proportion of afebrile subjects at 6 hours as the dependent variable and the treatment group as the independent variable, adjusting for temperature at 4 hours, previous antibiotic intake and previous antipyretic intake. Similar regression analyses were used to test the associations between the same predictors and the proportions of afebrile subjects at 7 and 8 hours as dependent variables.

Although our results suggest the superiority of the combined alternating regimen, our findings need to be confirmed in larger trials, since we were forced to stop the trial before achieving our calculated sample size. This was because of obstacles faced during recruitment that were primarily related to parental anxiety regarding children's participation in research, and to physicians' reluctance to permit enrolment of their patients in a clinical trial. Such obstacles have been encountered by many investigators and have been previously reported in the pediatric research literature [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="24213" xml_f="24215" txt_i="18755" txt_f="18757">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24222" xml_f="24476" txt_i="18757" txt_f="19011">].

However, both ibuprofen and acetaminophen are used in similar dosages and at similar intervals in inpatients as well as outpatients, irrespective of the severity of the primary disease. In addition, the antipyretic response associated with either drug does not correlate with the disease being viral or bacterial.

However, antipyretics were stopped for 8 hours prior to enrolment, the time at which a febrile subject may receive antipyretic treatment in "real clinical life". It may be argued that the antipyretic effects of the drugs investigated are confounded by antibiotic administration and previous antipyretic intake. However, since this was a randomized clinical trial, we anticipated that the randomization process would dilute these effects by distributing the subjects equally among the two treatment groups. Indeed, the proportions of subjects receiving antibiotics and those with prior antipyretic intake were not significantly different between the two groups, suggesting adequate randomization. In addition, and since the desired sample size was not achieved, we adjusted for antibiotic and antipyretic intakes in the logistic regression model, which revealed both variables to be insignificant predictors of the antipyretic response at 6, 7, and 8 hours.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="26279" xml_f="26304" txt_i="20782" txt_f="20807">Implications for practice</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="26315" xml_f="27126" txt_i="20808" txt_f="21619">Despite the effectiveness of the combined antipyretic regimen shown in this study, we emphasize that our findings should not be used as a justification for advising this practice.
