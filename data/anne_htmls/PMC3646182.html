On the other hand, the patients who participate in the decision-making process show greater treatment adherence and have better health outcomes. Different methods to encourage the active participation during oncological consultation have been described; however, similar studies in Italy are lacking. The aims of the present study are to (1) assess the effects of a preconsultation intervention to increase the involvement of breast cancer patients during the consultation, and (2) explore the role of the attending companions in the information exchange during consultation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9659" xml_f="9679" txt_i="739" txt_f="759">Methods and analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9690" xml_f="10647" txt_i="760" txt_f="1717">All female patients with breast cancer who attend the Oncology Out-patient Services for the first time will provide an informed consent to participate in the study. They are randomly assigned to the intervention or to the control group. The intervention consists of the presentation of a list of relevant illness-related questions, called a question prompt sheet. The primary outcome measure of the efficacy of the intervention is the number of questions asked by patients during the consultation. Secondary outcomes are the involvement of the patient by the oncologist; the patient's perceived achievement of her information needs; the patient's satisfaction and ability to cope; the quality of the doctor–patient relationship in terms of patient-centeredness; and the number of questions asked by the patient's companions and their involvement during the consultation. All outcome measures are supposed to significantly increase in the intervention group.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="10669" xml_f="10693" txt_i="1719" txt_f="1743">Ethics and dissemination</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10704" xml_f="10890" txt_i="1744" txt_f="1930">The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee of the Hospital Trust of Verona.

The STAI-X1R, administered after the consultation, is a shorter version of 10 out of the 20 items of the STAI-X1, and it is used to evaluate the state anxiety level at the end of the consultation and to compare this level with the one measured at the beginning. PHQ-9 is a self-assessment questionnaire for detecting the presence of depression and consists of nine items with response options of 0 (not at all) to 3 (almost every day), and has a summative score range of 0 to 27. We score it in the standard way, using the sum of the 0–3 scores for each item, and ≥8 as a cut-off score for possible cases of depression.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43"><offsets xml_i="46865" xml_f="46867" txt_i="29577" txt_f="29579">43</offsets></xref><sup><offsets xml_i="46879" xml_f="46880" txt_i="29579" txt_f="29580">–</offsets></sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45"><offsets xml_i="46918" xml_f="46920" txt_i="29580" txt_f="29582">45</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46927" xml_f="47091" txt_i="29582" txt_f="29743"> GHQ-12 is a self-administrated questionnaire of 12 items and has a summative score range of 0 to 12 and a cut-off score of &gt;3 indicating psychological distress.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46"><offsets xml_i="47123" xml_f="47125" txt_i="29743" txt_f="29745">46</offsets></xref></p></list-item><list-item><p><offsets xml_i="47162" xml_f="47243" txt_i="29746" txt_f="29827">Personality traits, measured with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQR-S).</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47"><offsets xml_i="47275" xml_f="47277" txt_i="29827" txt_f="29829">47</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47284" xml_f="47736" txt_i="29829" txt_f="30281"> The EPQR-S is a self-administered questionnaire of 48 items on yes/no scale.
