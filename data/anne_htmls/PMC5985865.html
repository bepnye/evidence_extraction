Ozone has been utilised effectively for the treatment of different disorders for over 100 years. Its special properties incorporate immuno-stimulant, pain relieving, antihypnotic, detoxicating, antimicrobial, bio-energetic and biosynthetic activities with powerful wound healing properties. Ozone is capable of interacting with blood constituents (erythrocytes, platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells) and induces oxygen metabolism, cell energy and immuno-modulatory changes. Ozone can enhance the antioxidant defence system and stimulate the microcirculation in tissues [</offsets><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="39603" xml_f="39605" txt_i="17006" txt_f="17008">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="39612" xml_f="39614" txt_i="17008" txt_f="17010">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39621" xml_f="39844" txt_i="17011" txt_f="17234">The findings of this study revealed that the sign scores decreased after treatment within the 3 groups where this decrease was statistically significant.

Adding to that, ozone favours tissue healing and increases blood perfusion. It can improve blood flow and immunological reaction. Ozone affects both the cellular and humoral immune responses, oxidises poisons making their discharge simpler, empowers the creation of immunocompetent cells and immunoglobulins, enhances phagocytosis capacity of macrophages, which closures inflammation and fasten tissue healing. Besides, ozone improves the oxygen conveying limit of blood causing better metabolism of inflamed tissues cells and more usage of energy using actuation of aerobic pathways of metabolism. What’s more, oxidant action of ozone helps protein production and upgrades cell ribosomes and mitochondria. Thus, cell action and recovery possibilities will be enhanced with the improvement of the tissue healing process.
