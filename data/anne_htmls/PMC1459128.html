An example of a large-scale approach in Norway is the social security arrangement called "Active Sick Leave" that was launched in the early 1990's making it possible for absentees to attend work by performing different and less strenuous tasks.

This approach has proven very useful in detecting, diagnosing and curing illness. However, in more diffuse and complex situations involving psychological stress and pain, we argue that this approach might be of limited value. We believe a focus on health, possibilities and future goals could be an important supplement for many persons in this type of situation. Should we keep treating most cases of mood variations as diseases or would it be more appropriate to develop other modes of facing this challenge?
