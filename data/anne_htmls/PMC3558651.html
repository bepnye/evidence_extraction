The study was explained to the patients prior to surgery and written consent forms were obtained. Total of 60 patients with over first-degree burns of 25% total body surface area that were scheduled for escharectomy and skin graft under general anesthesia participated in this study. These patients were 20 to 60 years old who were classified into physical class 2 or 3, based upon American Society Anesthesiologist. The study was conducted prospectively. The patients with following cases were excluded from the study; 1) patients with anamneses of diseases in the heart, liver, kidney, thyroid, and central nervous system, 2) patients who were administering vasodilators or other drugs that affect the temperature control, and 3) pregnant patients. The participants were randomly assigned to the control group, utilizing conventional breathing circuit, including a heat and moisture exchanger (HME), and a HBC group, using heated breathing circuit (RT 212 Adult inspiratory heated breathing circuit, Fisher &amp; Paykel healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand). HBC possesses a Y shaped-connection between 1.5 m of heated inspired limb and 1.76 m of unheated expired limb with a water trap. During the surgery, temperature of beds in both groups was set at 40℃ by using hyper-hypothermia unit (Blanketrol® 2, Cincinnati Sub-Zero, Cincinnati, USA) as an additional external heating method. Temperature of the operating room was maintained at 30-32℃. Also, all fluids and blood products were injected via fluid heating unit setting at 40℃.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8825" xml_f="11189" txt_i="4539" txt_f="6903">As a pre-treatment, 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate was injected intramuscularly an hour before the anesthesia induction; a standard patient monitoring device was attached in the operating room. Propofol, 2 mg/kg, and rocuronium, 0.8 mg/kg, were administered and then endotracheal intubation was carried out. A portable humidification and temperature measuring device (Medisize, Hillegom, Netherlands) was turned on to operate the automatic calibration system before patients came into the operating room. In the control group, the portable humidification and temperature measuring device was installed between HME connected to the anesthetic device (Aestiva/5, Datex Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) and endotracheal tubes; in the HBC group, the device was installed between its own Y-shaped connection and endotracheal tubes. Temperature and absolute humidity of the inspired gases in the breathing circuit were measured in real time and recorded every 15 minutes. After the anesthesia induction, an esophageal thermometer (REF 16561, Instrumentarium Corp. Helsinki, Finland) was inserted on the bottom esophagus orally, in order to measure the core temperature; a stethoscope was mounted at the best place to hear the heartbeats. Based upon the esophageal temperature right after the endotracheal intubation as the reference values, the temperature was measured every 15 minutes for 180 minutes. The temperature drop from the reference values to the measurements were calculated and then compared between the two groups. The anesthesia was maintained at 1.5 L/min of oxygen, 1.5 L/min of nitrous oxide, and 2-3 vol% of sevoflurane 2-3 vol%. Tidal volume, respiration rate, and end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide were held at 8-10 ml/kg, 12-16 rates/min, and 33-38 mmHg, respectively. Near the end of the surgery, pyridostigmine, 0.2 mg/kg, and glycopyrrolate, 0.004 mg/kg, were injected for recovery of muscle relaxation in the patients. Entire bodies except for faces and heads were disinfected with betadine solution in all patients and then the surgery was carried out as being exposed without covering special surgical drapes. Number of patients was calculated to be 24.5 subjects with α (0.05) and 1-β (0.9); the expected difference was 0.4 based upon 35.8 ± 0.5℃, which was the lowest temperature in the control group with HME utilization in previous study [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="11220" xml_f="11221" txt_i="6903" txt_f="6904">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="11228" xml_f="11777" txt_i="6904" txt_f="7453">].

If it is assumed that a healthy individual inhales gases with 50% of relative humidity at 22℃ through a nose, its absolute humidity is 10 mg/L. As inspired gases at 31-33℃ pass by the larynx, moisture content increases with 26-32 mg/L of absolute humidity and the relative humidity reaches 100%. The absolute humidity of the gases that pass by midtrachea and mainbronchi of the airway is 27-34 mg/L at 32-34℃ and 44 mg/L at 37℃, respectively, and the relative humidity is also 100% in the case. When endotracheal intubation is carried out, dry and cold gases reach to the bottom airway as physiological heating and humidification are omitted. This is why there is moisture and heat loss in respiratory systems. It also makes mucous more viscous by decreasing the ciliary transport function; ciliary movement stops when mucous gets severely viscous. So far, all the steps are reversible damages; however, if progressing further, it leads to lung compliance reductions and decreases of functional residual volume, atelectasis, and shunt as pneumocytes are damaged. The occurrence of these phenomena increases as prolonged gas inhalation increases [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="14863" xml_f="14864" txt_i="10212" txt_f="10213">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="14871" xml_f="14873" txt_i="10213" txt_f="10215">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14880" xml_f="15399" txt_i="10216" txt_f="10732">In the present study, the average temperature and absolute humidity of the HBC group were 37.4 ± 0.1℃ and 41.4 ± 0.2 mg/L, respectively, so that the relative humidity was kept at 96%.

In addition, when gases with 60% of relative humidity were utilized in humans for more than 1 hour, the damages were as much as ciliary function impairment, even if they were reversible. In the study, temperature and absolute humidity were 24℃ and 12 mg/L; compared to the results in the control group of the present study (31.2℃, 15.3 mg/L), absolute humidity was relatively higher in the present study, but relative humidity was lower as the temperature of the gases were higher.

As surgery related to burns is generally carried out for more than 3 hours even in the patients without inspired burns, it is necessary to maintain appropriate humidity during anesthesia for a long period of time. From this perspective, HBC would be greatly helpful in patients with severe burns. Right after anesthesia, body heat is transferred to peripheral parts, which possess a little lower temperature from the core parts because of vasodilatations by anesthetics, thereby occurring redistribution hypothermia that the core temperature decreases. This phenomenon lasts for an hour and the core temperature decreases by approximately 1-1.5℃ in the period. Afterward, the body temperature descends almost straightly by more than 3℃ for 2-3 hours, so that it finally reaches the plateau [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="17550" xml_f="17551" txt_i="12738" txt_f="12739">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17558" xml_f="17865" txt_i="12739" txt_f="13046">]. Besides, radiation due to the lower atmospheric temperature than that of body temperature, electric heat caused by surgical drapes, and evaporation from the surgical wounds are also the factors determining heat loss.

Threshold of temperature control in healthy individuals is 36.5-37.5℃; in case of patients with severe burns; however, it is proportional to the burned area. It is known that the threshold increases by approximately 0.03℃ per total body surface area. As such, in case of burns with more than 25%, the threshold is estimated to elevate by 0.75℃ approximately [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="18299" xml_f="18300" txt_i="13410" txt_f="13411">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18307" xml_f="18721" txt_i="13411" txt_f="13825">]. For such reasons, patients with severe burns feel tremble and discomfort at 36.5℃ and may have vasoconstriction in order to maintain higher body temperature.

This is because that surgery in patients with severe burns of 25% total body surface area may have a great amount of blood loss during a large area of skin tissue removal; also as the wound is spread widely, wound infection and blood clotting disorders, if occurring, are lethal. Therefore, careful monitoring and controlling of body temperature and vital signs are essential for safe anesthesia during the surgery of burned patients. About 90% of metabolic heat dissipates through the surface of the skin and only less than 10% dissipates via respiratory system. Hence, there is no doubt that the effects of heating and dehumidification of airway on maintaining body temperature are limited. Considering the mechanisms of redistribution hypothermia, the best way to maintain body temperature is by either heating the entire body before anesthesia or heating the skin during surgery. However, not only it is practically difficult and dangerous to heat the patients with severe burns whose body temperature has already elevated prior to surgery but also skin heating is unavailable in the case as the surgery is carried out while their entire body is disinfected and exposed without any surgical drapes. Due to such reasons, we made efforts to keep the temperature of the operating room higher than 30℃ and heat all fluids, including disinfecting fluids, that were injected to the patients; however, temperature drop was not completely inhibited. Thus, it was expected that the breathing circuit with heating function would reduce the temperature drop as described in other studies [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="20548" xml_f="20549" txt_i="15544" txt_f="15545">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20556" xml_f="20557" txt_i="15545" txt_f="15546">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="20588" xml_f="20589" txt_i="15546" txt_f="15547">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20596" xml_f="21830" txt_i="15547" txt_f="16781">]; but there was no effect observed in this study. This would be because of the body exposure during the surgery due to extensive skin loss in the burned patients. Even if warm disinfecting fluids are spread throughout the whole body when performing either escharectomy or skin graft, surrounding temperature is maximum 32℃, which is much lower than body temperature; hence, the heat of the body dissipates as the disinfecting fluids evaporate and radiation and conduction proceeds. In this condition, the maintained temperature was not significantly effective compared to the conventional breathing circuit, even though additional heat was applied to maintain them. However, body temperature in patients without burns during anesthesia decreased by 1-1.5℃ within an hour and further by more than 3℃ up till 3 hours; in contrast, the present study was found that the control group and the HBC group showed decreases just by 0.5 ± 0.5℃ and 0.5 ± 0.4℃ at 60 minute anesthesia, and 1.3 ± 0.8℃ and 0.9 ± 0.6℃ at 180 minute anesthesia, respectively. This may be caused by the effects of the various heating methods, including high temperature of the operating room. A study in patients with general anesthesia for lower abdominal surgery [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="21861" xml_f="21862" txt_i="16781" txt_f="16782">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21869" xml_f="22249" txt_i="16782" txt_f="17162">] reported that HBC didn't successfully reduce the temperature drop. They also explained the reasons for the exposure of the surgical sites; exposure of lower abdomen, which is the core of the body that causes heat loss as much as counterbalancing the heat in respiratory system. On the other hand, in a study reporting that HBC was effective on the body temperature maintenance [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><offsets xml_i="22280" xml_f="22281" txt_i="17162" txt_f="17163">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22288" xml_f="22506" txt_i="17163" txt_f="17381">], the types of surgery was not notified. In case where several types of surgery were included, the results might not be accurate since the body exposure would not be constantly controlled. Another study investigated [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="22537" xml_f="22538" txt_i="17381" txt_f="17382">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22545" xml_f="24577" txt_i="17382" txt_f="19414">] that HBC would decrease the temperature drop in early anesthesia compared to that of conventional circuit by reducing the heat loss due to airway evaporation and conduction in the early stage of hypothermia. The study was carried out in patients who received spinal surgery. After anesthesia, limbs and hips except for backs, the surgical sites, were heated in face-down positions utilizing forced air-warmer at 40-42℃. In result, the temperature drop 60 minutes after anesthesia was greater in the experimental group, but it was similar between the two groups up till 3 hours. In addition, the average temperature drop was approximately 1℃; it was also thought to be because of the additional heating device. Although it is difficult to conclude clearly, given the lack of information regarding the temperature of the operation room in the study, it seems that differences between the results might be because the temperature of the operation room of the present study is generally higher than others, so that it offsets the effects of HBC, thereby affecting the temperature drop of early anesthesia in both groups. Limitation of this study is that the effects of HBC only on body temperature are not able to be compared because of utilization of various heating methods, as mentioned previously. However, this study was considered to be reasonable because the effects of additional heating from breathing circuit were investigated under the same heating conditions in both groups and in the optimum environment to maintain body temperature of the patients for safety. In conclusion, the present study confirmed that HBC utilization during general anesthesia in patients with severe burns did not result in significant reduction of the core temperature drop during surgery. However, the humidity of the inspired gases was capable to be maintained ideally. In the future, more studies may need to be done regarding the methods to reduce the core temperature when performing anesthesia in patients with severe burns during surgery.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group
