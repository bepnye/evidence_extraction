Despite the adoption of gemcitabine monotherapy as a standard of care, outcomes remain poor. Until recently randomized phase III studies have not demonstrated superiority of various cytotoxic combinations or a number of the newer biologic targeted drugs. The situation has changed with capecitabine and erlotinib, either of which in combination with gemcitabine produces a small increase in survival. Erlotinib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor against epidermal growth factor receptor which has an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. In both pre-clinical and early clinical evaluation it has shown anti-tumor activity against pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine. A randomized phase III study in locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer has shown a survival advantage for the combination of gemcitabine plus erlotinib over gemcitabine alone. The rationale for the clinical development of erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer culminating in this randomized trial, together with pharmacologic, toxicity and patient selection considerations form the focus of this review.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>erlotinib</kwd><kwd>tarceva</kwd><kwd>capecitabine</kwd><kwd>xeloda</kwd><kwd>gemcitabine</kwd><kwd>epidermal growth factor receptor</kwd><kwd>pancreas</kwd><kwd>pancreatic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="4018" xml_f="4030" txt_i="1257" txt_f="1269">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4041" xml_f="4475" txt_i="1270" txt_f="1704">Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy, the vast majority of patients presenting with advanced unresectable disease.

Not only the presence but the intensity of skin rash appeared to correlate with survival in these trials.

Both represent important, albeit small, steps in improving outcome from this aggressive malignancy and the latter importantly validating an approach that has been rationally selected based on the perceived importance of one of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease. Both could be considered standard treatment options for advanced pancreatic cancer. However, quality of life and pharmacoeconomic considerations are likely to dictate the uptake of either approach and the latter are yet to be undertaken. Ongoing and future studies in advanced pancreatic cancer are building on combinatorial approaches and the next generation of trials are incorporating biologic agents with conventional cytotoxics and additionally combining biologic agents. This multi-targeted approach may ultimately prove more effective in treating what is effectively a chemo-resistant disease. Given the efficacy of erlotinib demonstrated in the Canadian trial, erlotinib or alternative EGFR inhibitors such as cetuximab, are likely to be part of this strategy.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
