The study was approved by local ethics committees at each participating institution. In brief, FIELD is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. Participants are middle-aged to elderly people (50 to 75 years of age) with type 2 diabetes mellitus considered to be at risk of coronary heart disease. The first patient in FIELD was registered in November 1997 and randomized in February 1998. A total of 14 247 subjects were registered, and 13 900 were screened in clinics for eligibility at Visit 1.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7977" xml_f="10122" txt_i="4793" txt_f="6938">Patients were recruited from 63 centres in Australia, New Zealand and Finland. Those with and without known vascular disease were eligible for participation provided that, at randomization, the usual physician considered that there was no current indication for lipid-modifying treatment. This meant that some patients meeting the FIELD eligibility criteria for lipid levels were instead treated by their usual doctors once they became aware of the patients' lipid profile at screening; therefore, such patients were not randomized and were not included in the study. Patients with or without lipid abnormalities, such as low HDL cholesterol or elevated triglycerides, were eligible if the total blood cholesterol level at screening fell between 3.0 and 6.5 mmol/L (about 115–250 mg/dL) and either the total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio was 4.0 or higher, or the triglyceride level was over 1.0 mmol/L. Patients were excluded if they had triglyceride levels over 5.0 mmol/L. Lipid entry criteria were consistent with recruiting people who would not qualify for fully subsidised lipid-modifying treatment under the government guidelines in all 3 countries. Participants could not be taking any lipid-modifying therapy at the start of the dietary run-in period. However, the protocol allows for statin or other lipid-lowering therapy to be added at any time after randomization and recommends continuing study medication. The study is thus evaluating the role of fenofibrate on a background of usual care and will provide safety data on fibrate therapy in combination with other lipid-lowering treatments. A prespecified analysis will explore the effects of fenofibrate separately among those patients taking other lipid-lowering agents during follow-up and those taking study treatment alone. Intention-to-treat methods of analysis will result in conservative estimates of any effects of fenofibrate in the event that drop-ins to statin treatment are more frequent in the placebo-treated group. Confounding with respect to other drug use should be prevented by the randomization process, which will result in good balance across the treatment groups.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10129" xml_f="10697" txt_i="6939" txt_f="7507">Patients known to have type 2 diabetes (identified through hospital clinic records, diabetes society membership lists and various patient registers) were invited to attend a special clinic.

Both laboratories participated in local external quality assurance programs. Eligibility was confirmed for consenting participants.
