Mucosal intestinal permeability can be assessed noninvasively by measuring urinary excretion of orally administered test substances. Typically, this involves estimation of the urinary recovery of single or multiple probes administered orally. Quantifying the absorption of two sugars of different sizes offers advantages compared with the use of single probes: urinary recovery of these probes expressed as a ratio is particularly sensitive because this can reflect the contrasting effects of decreased absorption of monosaccharides, such as rhamnose or mannitol, owing to the reduced surface area and increased permeability for larger disaccharides, such as lactulose or cellobiose, owing to the opening of intracellular pathways. A further advantage of this ratio is the elimination of errors due to non-mucosal factors, because variables such as rate of gastric emptying, intestinal transit, impairment of renal function, and completeness of urinary collection should affect both sugars similarly [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><offsets xml_i="6011" xml_f="6012" txt_i="2637" txt_f="2638">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6019" xml_f="6021" txt_i="2638" txt_f="2640">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6028" xml_f="6214" txt_i="2641" txt_f="2827">In experimental animals, fluid loading increased the urinary recovery of intravenously administered lactulose but not rhamnose, and thereby increased the lactulose/rhamnose (L/R) ratio [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="6245" xml_f="6246" txt_i="2827" txt_f="2828">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6253" xml_f="6487" txt_i="2828" txt_f="3062">], suggesting changes in tissue distribution or altered renal handling of the sugar probes.
