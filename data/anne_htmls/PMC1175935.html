A significant reduction in mortality was seen when infants were resuscitated in room air compared to 100% oxygen. It is astonishing that a brief exposure of only a few minutes to 100% oxygen may be so toxic to the newborn infant; this finding, however, is supported by increasing evidence from experimental work emphasising that resuscitation in 100% oxygen may be associated with an aggravation of cellular injury when compared with resuscitation in air. It is imperative that these findings are reflected in the new newborn resuscitation guidelines and that further research continues in this area of neonatal medicine.

Defining the optimum technique for neonatal resuscitation is an extremely important challenge and has the potential to improve neonatal outcome globally.

One death would be prevented for every 20 babies resuscitated with air versus 100% oxygen. Several hundred thousand deaths might be prevented by avoiding 100% oxygen during resuscitation. It is astonishing that a brief exposure of only a few minutes to 100% oxygen may be so toxic to newborn infants. A brief review of the experimental, basic science and clinical literature on this subject adds weight to this finding. It is imperative that newborn resuscitation guidelines are now revised.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="4214" xml_f="4400" txt_i="2502" txt_f="2688">The process of childbirth is accompanied by increased oxidative stress, as birth itself is a hyperoxic challenge.
