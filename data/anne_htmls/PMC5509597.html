training for trunk movements on trunk muscle control and proprioception in stroke
patients. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 12 study subjects were randomly assigned to
the experimental group (a motor imagery training group) and the control group (a
neurodevelopmental treatment, NDT) group. The two groups were treated five times (30
minutes each time) per week for 4 weeks. The experimental group underwent imagery training
for 10 minutes and trunk control centered NDT for 20 minutes and the control group
underwent only trunk control centered NDT for 30 minutes. The trunk muscle activity and
the position sense of the subjects were evaluated before and after the intervention.
[Results] The two groups showed significant improvements in muscle activity after the
intervention. Only the experimental group showed significant improvements in
proprioception. The experimental group showed significant improvements in the variations
of muscle activity and proprioception compared to the control group. [Conclusion] Motor
imagery training for trunk movements can be effectively used to improve trunk muscle
activity and proprioception in stroke patients.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Motor imagery training</kwd><kwd>Muscle activity</kwd><kwd>Proprioception</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title><offsets xml_i="4634" xml_f="4646" txt_i="1256" txt_f="1268">INTRODUCTION</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4657" xml_f="4931" txt_i="1269" txt_f="1543">A stroke is a life-threatening neurological disorder.

not lower than 24 points, those with a score of at least 40 points in a vividness of
movement imagery questionnaire, and those with no other neurological or orthopedic

collected signals were analyzed by full wave rectification, followed by processing with the
root mean square (RMS) method. The maximal voluntary isometric contraction (% MVIC) of each
muscle was measured to normalize muscle activity values. For the measurement, the patient
was instructed to maintain an isometric contraction for five seconds while the shoulder was
lifted up to 20° from the floor during a sit-up in a hook lying position. Each measurement

exercise is applied to stroke patients, the patients showed improvement in their trunk

using Swiss balls, the patients showed improvement in lumbar proprioception. However,
whereas the control group did not show any significant difference between before and after
the intervention, the motor imagery training group showed significantly larger differences
in all results compared to the control group. This suggests that improvement in trunk
proprioception and the activation of trunk muscles through motor imagery training can
prevent falls that may have occurred and play an important role in activities of daily
living and balance.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23904" xml_f="24285" txt_i="13955" txt_f="14336">However, there are several problems in interpreting the results of the present study.
First, because the number of patients is small, it is difficult to generalize the results to
all stroke patients. Second, the present study included only a few muscles not allowing for
the evaluation of long-term effects and functions. These limitations should be complemented
in future studies.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Meijer</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Ihnenfeldt</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name><name><surname>de Groot</surname><given-names>IJ</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Prognostic factors for ambulation and activities of daily
