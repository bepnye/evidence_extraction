Randomization applied permuted block scheme for balancing interval, varying randomly among 3, 6, 9 and12 according to the outcome of a computer generated random number. This ensured that the cumulative number of assignments to each treatment would be in balance after each block of assignments had been made. The allocation sequence was written by the statistician involved with the trial. Once treatment arm status was assigned by the research assistant, subjects in the intervention arms were assigned a study nurse practitioner.

However, if the subject remained unable to identify a reason for lapse in self-care behavior or to devise a coping strategy, the interviewer worked with the subject to negotiate a change in another self-care behavior as a compensation for the perturbed behavior.
