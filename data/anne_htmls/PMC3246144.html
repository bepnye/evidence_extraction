The metamemory concept has three phrases; metaknowledge, metamonitoring, and metajugement. Pour knowledge, the participants can obtain information what they believe or think about their personal memory performance and collective cognitive aging, about what works in the process of memorizing. Through monitoring, the elders obtain judgments at the metamemorial level about the knowledge or strategies. We offer the practical opportunity to find a distinction between prospective and retrospective monitoring about memory performance by applying multimemory strategies that clarifies the effect of each strategy. The program consists of a total of 10 sessions every week. Each session is comprised of 3 parts, and it takes 90 minutes to complete the session. The goal of the first part of each session is to strengthen metaknowledge, based on theoretical models of the memory process and cognitive aging. All participants were educated through visual stimuli consisting of drawings, charts and pictures provided by professional illustrators and computer graphic designers. We help the elderly understand and accept the concept of cognitive aging, suggest efficient strategies for dealing with cognitive aging and provide guidance on implementing these strategies into their daily lives. The second and third parts of each session focus on metamonitoring, metajugement, memory training via the practice of external and internal strategies. The second part consists of collective memory training, and the third part includes personal memory training. The materials used in memory training are developed through the collaboration of psychiatrists, psychologists and illustrators. The collective memory training is structured so that stimuli can be given through a computer screen. In the personal training, the problems are given on paper, emphasizing metamonitoring.

First, we did not examine how long the effect can be maintained. Second, our study has a limitation stemming from its small sample size. Further studies with a large sample size are needed to confirm that memory training with a metamemory approach affects daily life activities and how long this effect is maintained. Analytical methods in our study were adequately powered but we did not adjust for multiple comparisons, which might make some of type I errors. To our knowledge, this is the first study that showed the effect of specialized memory training with the metamemory concept for a normal elderly Korean population. Our method for memory training will help the normal elderly improve their quality of life.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by Basic
