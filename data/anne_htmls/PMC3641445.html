Concerns identified by participants during the formal feedback, for example, having too many people involved in one's care may have contributed to poor response rates and rewording of participant recruitment documentation to reassure participants of the role of the pharmacist could address this. More participants withdrew in the prescribing arm compared with the other two arms, which might be attributed to the need for an additional practice visit. The study was an exploratory trial so no formal power calculation was undertaken. However, because there were no published MIDs available to estimate effect size for the outcomes in this population, it was important to present the actual clinical magnitude of change in outcome at 6 months alongside a statistical assessment of this change (p value). This allows an assessment of both clinical and statistical significance simultaneously with the caveat that this is an exploratory study. With around 50 patients per arm, this was deemed sufficient numbers to examine the change in outcome measures with appropriate within-group and between-group univariate statistical tests. Owing to the nature of the intervention, no participants were blind to their group allocation, and so some outcomes, especially the qualitative components, may have been affected by social desirability bias.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="73335" xml_f="73448" txt_i="32343" txt_f="32456">Our outcome measures were self-reported, but this is the norm in pain studies as pain is a subjective experience.</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18"><offsets xml_i="73480" xml_f="73482" txt_i="32456" txt_f="32458">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="73489" xml_f="73624" txt_i="32458" txt_f="32593"> Furthermore we do not know how important the observed differences were to participants.

However, the reduction in overall score appears to be mediated by a change in the intensity of pain subscale rather than in pain-related disability. The effect size of 0.45 suggests this could be an important difference. In contrast, the SF-12, a measure of general health and functionality showed no significant difference between intervention arms, reflecting either no effect or or lack of power to detect an effect.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="75681" xml_f="75991" txt_i="34426" txt_f="34736">While most participants in this study were already within the normal range on the HADS scale, and therefore had minimal chance of improvement, there were nonetheless suggestions of better ourcomes in participants in the prescribing arm.

This might seem contradictory to the possible greater benefit found in the prescribing arm. However, in the prescribing arm pharmacists met the participant and may have more readily identified and dismissed suggestions previously tried. The interview feedback highlighted that some recommendations for change, while sensible, had been tried already. This might also be the reason why there were only 60% of pharmacist recommendations with which the GP fully agreed. Self-reported adherence to medication at baseline was good. Despite this, the pharmacists still improved pain outcomes in the prescribing arm. This could have been due to changes in medications and/or participant education about optimal timing for administration of analgesic medicines. Further research is needed to confirm the beneficial effect of pharmacist prescribing and its sustainability.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title><offsets xml_i="77304" xml_f="77314" txt_i="35915" txt_f="35925">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="77325" xml_f="77593" txt_i="35926" txt_f="36194">Our results suggest that pharmacist prescribing (and possibly pharmacist review alone) for patients with chronic pain is feasible, acceptable and may lead to improvements in pain and other measures.
