Although supplements can be an important source of calcium, this project focused on food-derived calcium. Secondary aims were to compare food source of calcium between black and white women aged 60 years or older and evaluate the adequacy of calcium intake as assessed using the 24-hour recall and the CFFFQ.

In contrast, the CFFFQ is unique in providing 14 fortified food choices, including 1 in fruits, 8 in grains, and 5 in "other" food categories. Fortification of foods can contribute greatly to total calcium intake. From our data, inclusion of calcium-fortified foods in the diet has the potential to increase total daily calcium intake by 1,000 mg or more. Because calcium fortification of food products is not federally regulated, food items being fortified and levels of fortification vary at the discretion of the manufacturer.

The CFFFQ can be used to more accurately identify calcium intakes and usual calcium source, which is of interest because of the increasing availability of calcium-fortified foods. Calcium-fortified sources can go unreported in 24-hour recalls and diaries, leading to an underestimation of calcium intake. When 24-hour recalls are used to assess and quantify calcium intake, researchers and clinicians need to clarify with clients whether the foods they ate were fortified. The CFFFQ may be used to better quantify calcium intake, including both natural and fortified sources. Accurate assessment of calcium is critical in evaluating bone health risks.
