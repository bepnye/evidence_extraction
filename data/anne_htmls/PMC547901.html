Effects of treatment and gender on independent variables were assessed using ANCOVA, with the baseline score as well as the number of weeks in the study as covariates. The relationship between change in weight and change in each outcome variable was assessed using separate multiple linear regression analyses, each with corresponding clinical change score as a dependent variable, the corresponding baseline score and number of weeks in the study as covariates, and the following independent variables: weight change, treatment group assignment, and gender. In an additional analysis, the interactions of these three independent variables were added to the regression models.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19203" xml_f="19500" txt_i="14601" txt_f="14898">The analyses included measures from baseline and the 6-week visit.

Improved patients on haloperidol gained 0.08 kg while those who deteriorated lost 0.44 kg (F(1, 617) = 2.9, p = 0.087). In order to directly compare current findings with those previously reported by Czobor and associates, we repeated the analysis using their analytical variables (absolute weight change (kg) and PANSS total score), while covarying baseline bodyweight and baseline PANSS total score.

The partial correlations between weight gain (kg) and therapeutic response as measured by the PANSS total score (controlling for baseline weight, baseline PANSS total score, and weeks of treatment) were statistically significant for the olanzapine and haloperidol treatment groups (partial r = -0.15, N = 1279, p &lt; 0.001 for olanzapine; partial r = -0.11, N = 618, p = 0.006 for haloperidol).

This link impacted olanzapine-treated patients more than those treated with haloperidol because improved clinical and functional outcomes were more pronounced for the olanzapine-treated patients, who were also more likely to experience weight gain than patients treated with haloperidol.

Patient attrition from studies is not random, with those experiencing poor treatment efficacy or poor tolerability being more likely to discontinue the study, leaving a relatively homogeneous group of study completers who are also treatment responders. Such reduction in the variability of treatment outcomes may diminish the likelihood of finding this phenomenon in long term randomized double blind studies. Further, if this phenomenon were to be investigated in long-term naturalistic observational studies, one would likely face another problem, namely the prevalent use of polypharmacy [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50"><offsets xml_i="54671" xml_f="54673" txt_i="39170" txt_f="39172">50</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="54680" xml_f="54739" txt_i="39172" txt_f="39231">], and the dynamic nature of treatment for schizophrenia, [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51"><offsets xml_i="54771" xml_f="54773" txt_i="39231" txt_f="39233">51</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="54780" xml_f="55022" txt_i="39233" txt_f="39475">] with frequent changes in antipsychotic regimens and in concomitant psychotropic medications.

It is possible that weight gain and improvement occurred together because improvements occur mostly in patients who are medication adherent. Although this was not assessed in the present study, this possibility was previously studied by Meltzer et al. [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="55828" xml_f="55830" txt_i="40237" txt_f="40239">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="55837" xml_f="57123" txt_i="40239" txt_f="41525">], who found a significant association between clozapine-emergent weight gain and improved psychopathology. In their study, non-adherent patients were expected to have lower or absent plasma clozapine levels, but there was no relationship between plasma clozapine levels and weight gain or clinical response. Meltzer and colleagues also monitored adherence closely during weekly visits to determine white blood count and found no evidence of intermittent or poor adherence in their study patients. Additionally, the associations between weight gain and improved outcomes in our study were similarly found within the haloperidol and within the olanzapine treatment groups when controlling for treatment duration. Treatment duration is a proxy for time on the medication in randomized double-blind trials, where treatment discontinuation for any reason results in patient's discontinuation from the study. Thus, if patients were more adherent with one antipsychotic drug than with the other, and medication adherence influenced the associations between weight gain and outcomes, then one would expect to find the association between weight gain and improved outcomes to be present only in the more adherent treatment group, but not in both treatment groups, as found in the present study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="57130" xml_f="57634" txt_i="41526" txt_f="42030">Another study limitation is the correlational nature of the analyses, which precludes cause-effect relationship and allows for the possibility that the observed associations might be due to an unobserved variable or set of variables. Further, the relatively low correlations suggest that the association explains only a small proportion of the variance in treatment outcomes. Response to antipsychotic medications is a complex phenomenon that is associated by numerous relatively independent components [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="57666" xml_f="57668" txt_i="42030" txt_f="42032">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="57675" xml_f="58216" txt_i="42032" txt_f="42573">] and weight gain is only one of them. Nonetheless, this link was demonstrated when using other statistical approaches, including contrasting of weight gains between responders and patients who did not respond, by identifying the degree of improvement associated with every 1-kg gained at 6 weeks, and by calculating the conditional probability of therapeutic response given various amounts of weight gain. These findings are important as they suggest that acute weight gain is a valuable prognostic marker in the treatment of schizophrenia.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="58223" xml_f="58977" txt_i="42574" txt_f="43328">Next, because the study included patients with a moderately severe level of symptomatology, the current findings may not generalize to patients with milder or residual symptoms of schizophrenia. However, the relationships among the severity of patients' baseline symptomatology, treatment-emergent weight gain and therapeutic response is currently unclear. And lastly, this study used the SF-36, a self-report measure of functional status, which was not designed to assess the potential impact of weight gain on patients' functional status or quality of life. Preliminary information on the first measure designed to specifically capture the impact of antipsychotic-emergent weight gain on patients' psychosocial functioning was only recently published [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52"><offsets xml_i="59009" xml_f="59011" txt_i="43328" txt_f="43330">52</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="59018" xml_f="59221" txt_i="43330" txt_f="43533">].

To the contrary, they had significant improvements in core symptoms of schizophrenia, depressive symptoms, and mental and physical level of functioning. Although excessive weight gain, regardless of origin, is of concern due to its association with physical health problems, the current findings suggest that patients who have greater treatment-emergent weight gain are more likely to benefit from treatment with olanzapine or haloperidol. Findings highlight the complexity inherent in medication management of schizophrenia patients and the need to balance treatment risks and benefits for each patient. In addition, further prospective studies will be required to assess the effects of weight gain, in both psychiatric and medical terms, on individuals treated for schizophrenia with various antipsychotic medications.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="60271" xml_f="60290" txt_i="44533" txt_f="44552">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="60301" xml_f="60374"
