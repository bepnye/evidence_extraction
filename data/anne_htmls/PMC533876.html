While some of these characteristics have been addressed by available software, none of them have all of these capabilities integrated into one package. The main objective of the Random Allocation Software project was to enhance the user's control over different aspects of randomization in parallel group trials, including output type and format, structure and ordering of generated unique identifiers and enabling users to specify group names for more than two groups.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="3141" xml_f="3148" txt_i="719" txt_f="726">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3159" xml_f="3598" txt_i="727" txt_f="1166">The program has different settings for: simple and blocked randomizations; length, format and ordering of generated unique identifiers; type and format of program output; and saving sessions for future use.

In the final report of the trial, authors should specify the method of sequence generation, i.e. whether they have used mechanical means, a computer generated random list or random number table. After preparing a random sequence, subjects will be allocated to the trial groups using an implementation method such as numbered containers, central telephone line, or allocation by a person who is not involved in the main research and patient care (the encoder). During the process of allocation each subject will be given a unique identification code (Unique Identifier, UI). This UI will be used as a label to uniquely identify the patient's group after completion of the study. During the study period this UI will be given to the main researchers together with the necessary treatment (e.g. drug or placebo). Usually these treatments are prepared by the encoder with the same physical characteristics (shape, color, size, etc), differing only by the UI labels to blind the main researchers about the actual patient group. Following enrollment of all subjects into the study, these UIs are decoded to determine the patient group. Depending on the preference of the researchers or facilities of the research environment, subjects are randomly allocated to intervention groups using either a random list prepared before the study (In Advance method) or a randomized allocation at the moment of intended intervention (Just In Time method; JIT). Both the JIT and In Advance methods produce acceptable allocations, and the actual choice depends on the availability of certain facilities for each method. Usually the randomization components of these two methods are produced by running a randomization software on either an Internet service provider or a local computer. The local encoder will obtain the next allocation (JIT method) or the entire random list (In Advance method) from the service provider or from the software on local computer and prepare the necessary blinded equipments.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6085" xml_f="6340" txt_i="3516" txt_f="3771">Without the use of computer software or Internet services the maintenance of the whole process of randomization and allocation is difficult.

Among these available services, the tool in Randomization.com [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="7166" xml_f="7167" txt_i="4414" txt_f="4415">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7174" xml_f="8531" txt_i="4415" txt_f="5772">] seems to be more advanced than the others. It allows users to specify the number of subjects per block, the number of blocks and up to 20 treatment labels. Therefore, this service produces simple and block randomization using fixed and equal block sizes. Unfortunately, this service does not allow further restriction on block design (e.g., multiple block lengths or random variation in block number or size). The generated random list is in the form of UI and group name pairs, formatted in a single column, which in cases of large sample sizes may require further work to fit it in multiple columns for fine printing. Moreover, the block borders are not visible to allow for easy visual inspection of block sizes and equality of cases. Although a minor problem, Randomization.com only produces sequential numeric UIs with variable lengths (e.g. 1, 10, 100). The variability in lengths of UIs may disturb the visual impact of the generated list compared to the fixed length UIs (e.g. 001, 010, 100). Some researchers prefer to use random UIs in mixed alphanumeric format to decrease the likelihood of memorization and to improve the blindness of the study and concealment of allocations. Available randomization software have more restrictions in their capabilities than the Internet randomization services.

Once installed and run, there are some controls in the main window for specifying the number of groups (2 to 16), sample size and the name of each group. It also contains menu items to determine the program output and randomization settings. The default program output is saved into either html or text files, and it may also have output to a window or to the system clipboard. A variety of randomization options can be set in the options window. The length of generated UIs (named as Code in the program) can be between 3 to 10 characters and there are options for different alphanumeric structures. In addition, these UIs can appear in sequential or random order in the generated random list. The program can generate simple or block randomization in different types, including equal size blocks, multiple block lengths with random variation among the specified block sizes and complete randomized blocks (random number and size of blocks). The generated sequence will appear in a multiple columns format and the number of columns (1 to 10) can be changed in the options window. Output to html file will be formatted in the form of one block per table. Borders of the tables may be shown or hidden. By clicking the 'Generate' button in the main window the random sequence will be generated and opened by the default viewer for the output file (e.g. Internet Explorer for html files). Previously created output files can also be viewed from inside the program. Additional options include saving the current randomization settings, loading a previous setting and enabling the program to save the last setting upon program exit.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11465" xml_f="11729" txt_i="8500" txt_f="8764">During execution, the program produces a random sequence of allocation using the Rnd function that generates a floating point random number.

Available randomization software generally has limitations in the number of groups, naming each group, generating UIs and control over the output. Many of these problems have been addressed in the present software. As has been stated in previous sections, the main use of this software is for randomization in parallel group trials. The software can be revised to support crossover and other types of randomized trials. The experienced user may test the randomness of the program output by selecting numeric labels for group names and then exporting the generated list into a statistical software such as SPSS to execute a runs test on the exported data.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="20893" xml_f="20922" txt_i="14189" txt_f="14218">Availability and requirements</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="20933" xml_f="20973" txt_i="14219" txt_f="14259">Project name: Random Allocation Software</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="20980" xml_f="20998" txt_i="14260" txt_f="14278">Public use access:</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.msaghaei.com/Softwares/dnld/RA.zip"></ext-link><offsets xml_i="21105" xml_f="21122" txt_i="14279" txt_f="14296"> (Latest version)</offsets></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.mui.ac.ir/RA.zip"></ext-link></p><p><offsets xml_i="21218" xml_f="21641" txt_i="14298" txt_f="14721">Operating systems: Windows 98, Me, 2000, XP.
