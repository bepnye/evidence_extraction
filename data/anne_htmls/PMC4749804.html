Thirty-six participants who have been diagnosed with (LSS) and recommended for spinal surgery by neurosurgeons or orthopedics and have had spinal symptoms such as severe low back pain and neurological claudication regardless of at least three months of conservative treatments will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned to be one of the three intervention groups, including the Mokhuri treatment program group 1 or 2 or usual care group. All treatments will be administered in inpatient units over a period of 4 weeks. The primary outcomes are 0 to 100 Visual Analogue Scales for low back pain and leg pain and the secondary outcomes are Oswestry Disability Index; EQ-5D; Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire; Oxford Claudication Score; physical function test, including treadmill test, walking duration, and distance assessment for free leg pain; radiologic testing; and adverse events which will be assessed during the 4-week treatment period as well as after 3 and 6 months of follow-up.

A total of 36 LSS patients with intractable symptoms that did not subside by at least three months of conventional treatment will be recruited through advertisements in newspapers and websites for these patient communities. This is a pilot study for future, full-scaled clinical trials. As a result, 12 patients will be recruited for each group without a sample size calculation for the minimum participant number according to statistical analysis of their basic information, considering possible dropouts. Because patients with both spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis and therapeutic responses of spinal stenosis with and without spondylolisthesis are expected to differ, we will recruit 2 patients with spondylolisthesis into the 12 participants of each group to assess the difference in the clinical outcomes. The study will be conducted at the Spine Center of Mokhuri Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.
