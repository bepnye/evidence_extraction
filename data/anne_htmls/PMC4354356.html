It is proposed that these effects may be more involved in early phases of drug addiction, whereas negative reinforcement effects may occur more in later stages of the illness. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore whether acute heroin substitution also induced positive reinforcement effects in striatal brain regions of protracted heroin-maintained patients. Using independent component analysis and a dual regression approach, we compared resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) strengths within the basal ganglia/limbic network across a group of heroin-dependent patients receiving both an acute infusion of heroin and placebo and 20 healthy subjects who received placebo only. Subsequent correlation analyses were performed to test whether the rsFC strength under heroin exposure correlated with the subjective rewarding effect and with plasma concentrations of heroin and its main metabolites morphine. Relative to the placebo treatment in patients, heroin significantly increased rsFC of the left putamen within the basal ganglia/limbic network, the extent of which correlated positively with patients' feelings of rush and with the plasma level of morphine. Furthermore, healthy controls revealed increased rsFC of the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus in this network relative to the placebo treatment in patients. Our results indicate that acute heroin substitution induces a subjective rewarding effect via increased striatal connectivity in heroin-dependent patients, suggesting that positive reinforcement effects in the striatum still occur after protracted maintenance therapy.</offsets></p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title><offsets xml_i="7064" xml_f="7076" txt_i="1790" txt_f="1802">Introduction</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7087" xml_f="7254" txt_i="1803" txt_f="1970">The initial development of drug addiction is mainly driven by pleasurable hedonic effects, which promote renewed drug intake through positive reinforcement mechanisms.</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"><offsets xml_i="7292" xml_f="7293" txt_i="1970" txt_f="1971">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7300" xml_f="7302" txt_i="1971" txt_f="1973">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"><offsets xml_i="7335" xml_f="7336" txt_i="1973" txt_f="1974">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7343" xml_f="7345" txt_i="1974" txt_f="1976">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3"><offsets xml_i="7378" xml_f="7379" txt_i="1976" txt_f="1977">3</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="7392" xml_f="7608" txt_i="1977" txt_f="2193"> Experimental evidence in animals revealed that the subjective rewarding effects of acute drug intake are crucially mediated by reinforcement signals in dopamine (DA)-innervated midbrain regions such as the striatum.</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4"><offsets xml_i="7646" xml_f="7647" txt_i="2193" txt_f="2194">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7654" xml_f="7656" txt_i="2194" txt_f="2196">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5"><offsets xml_i="7689" xml_f="7690" txt_i="2196" txt_f="2197">5</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="7703" xml_f="7931" txt_i="2197" txt_f="2425"> Imaging studies in humans have supported this hypothesis by showing that drug intake acutely increased the extracellular concentration of DA in the striatum and that these increases were associated with their rewarding effects.</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6"><offsets xml_i="7969" xml_f="7970" txt_i="2425" txt_f="2426">6</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="7983" xml_f="8148" txt_i="2426" txt_f="2591"> That is, the subjects who had the greatest striatal DA increases after acute drug administration were the ones who experienced the rewarding effects most intensely.</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"><offsets xml_i="8186" xml_f="8187" txt_i="2591" txt_f="2592">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8194" xml_f="8196" txt_i="2592" txt_f="2594">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8"><offsets xml_i="8229" xml_f="8230" txt_i="2594" txt_f="2595">8</offsets></xref></sup></p><p><offsets xml_i="8250" xml_f="8261" txt_i="2596" txt_f="2607">Behavioral,</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"><offsets xml_i="8299" xml_f="8300" txt_i="2607" txt_f="2608">9</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="8313" xml_f="8334" txt_i="2608" txt_f="2629"> electrophysiological</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10"><offsets xml_i="8373" xml_f="8375" txt_i="2629" txt_f="2631">10</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="8388" xml_f="8406" txt_i="2631" txt_f="2649"> and neurochemical</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><offsets xml_i="8445" xml_f="8447" txt_i="2649" txt_f="2651">11</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="8460" xml_f="8605" txt_i="2651" txt_f="2796"> evidences from animal research have demonstrated that opiates also activate the DA system, which is essential for their acute rewarding effects.</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12"><offsets xml_i="8644" xml_f="8646" txt_i="2796" txt_f="2798">12</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="8659" xml_f="8949" txt_i="2798" txt_f="3088"> In more detail, heroin mainly exerts its effects through μ- and κ-opiate receptor agonism;

Notably, the extent of rsFC strength of the left putamen after heroin administration correlated positively with the subjective experience of rush and with the plasma levels of heroin's main psychoactive metabolite morphine.
