Symptom-modifying drugs are at present the prescription of choice for patients with OA. Drugs in this group are: simple analgesics (such as acetaminophen) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Both acetaminophen and NSAIDs are effective in relieving symptoms of OA.

Also, several other uncertainties exist concerning the symptom-modifying properties of GS. For example, most trials were only of short-term duration (e.g. mean 6.25 weeks [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="7879" xml_f="7880" txt_i="3282" txt_f="3283">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7887" xml_f="8596" txt_i="3283" txt_f="3992">]) and it is therefore not possible to draw conclusions about the long-term efficacy. Another problem is that the mechanism behind the improvement of symptoms due to GS is not known. If GS directly influences the remaining cartilage, it would seem plausible that the symptomatic effect is greater in people with mild to moderate OA than in people with more severe OA, because there is more cartilage remaining in the first group. However, this possible difference in effect between different stages of OA has not been tested yet in a randomised clinical trial (RCT). These uncertainties make further study into the magnitude of long-term symptom-modifying effects in different stages of the disease justified.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8603" xml_f="8773" txt_i="3993" txt_f="4163">Concerning disease-modifying effects, two recent long-term (three years) trials in patients with knee OA did report some evidence that GS affected the progression of OA [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="8804" xml_f="8805" txt_i="4163" txt_f="4164">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8812" xml_f="8813" txt_i="4164" txt_f="4165">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="8844" xml_f="8845" txt_i="4165" txt_f="4166">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8852" xml_f="9053" txt_i="4166" txt_f="4367">].

Whereas joint space narrowing (JSN), had significantly progressed in the placebo groups, it had not in the groups that were taking GS.

What is the long-term cost-effectiveness of addition of GS to usual care? And, does GS prevent the onset or progression of OA in the contralateral hip joint? Additional to these clinical questions, the data will be used to look at changes on cell-level caused by GS to learn more about its possible mechanisms of action.

This number is used for labelling study materials and data. By stratifying, patients are optimally distributed to GS and placebo in the different strata, which makes comparing people with mild OA to people with moderate-severe OA, and comparing people with local OA to people with generalised OA possible. In this way, we will be able to study whether effect of treatment depends on severity or localisation of OA.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label><offsets xml_i="17115" xml_f="17122" txt_i="11827" txt_f="11834">Table 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="17142" xml_f="17177" txt_i="11834" txt_f="11869">Outline of the randomisation strata</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="17271" xml_f="17285" txt_i="11871" txt_f="11885">Hip radiograph</offsets></bold></td><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="17320" xml_f="17345" txt_i="11886" txt_f="11911">Knee and hand radiographs</offsets></bold></td><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="17380" xml_f="17384" txt_i="11912" txt_f="11916">Type</offsets></bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="17443" xml_f="17450" txt_i="11917" txt_f="11924">Group 1</offsets></bold></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17479" xml_f="17495" txt_i="11925" txt_f="11938">K-L score &lt; 2</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17517" xml_f="17553" txt_i="11939" txt_f="11972">K-L score &lt; 2 for hands and knees</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17575" xml_f="17591" txt_i="11973" txt_f="11989">mild + localised</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="17628" xml_f="17635" txt_i="11990" txt_f="11997">Group 2</offsets></bold></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17664" xml_f="17680" txt_i="11998" txt_f="12011">K-L score &lt; 2</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17702" xml_f="17738" txt_i="12012" txt_f="12048">K-L score ≥ 2 for hands and/or knees</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17760" xml_f="17778" txt_i="12049" txt_f="12067">mild + generalised</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="17815" xml_f="17822" txt_i="12068" txt_f="12075">Group 3</offsets></bold></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17851" xml_f="17864" txt_i="12076" txt_f="12089">K-L score ≥ 2</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17886" xml_f="17922" txt_i="12090" txt_f="12123">K-L score &lt; 2 for hands and knees</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="17944" xml_f="17971" txt_i="12124" txt_f="12151">moderate/severe + localised</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="18008" xml_f="18015" txt_i="12152" txt_f="12159">Group 4</offsets></bold></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18044" xml_f="18057" txt_i="12160" txt_f="12173">K-L score ≥ 2</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18079" xml_f="18115" txt_i="12174" txt_f="12210">K-L score ≥ 2 for hands and/or knees</offsets></td><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="18137" xml_f="18166" txt_i="12211" txt_f="12240">moderate/severe + generalised</offsets></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18223" xml_f="18235" txt_i="12242" txt_f="12254">Measurements</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18246" xml_f="18491" txt_i="12255" txt_f="12500">Data for the primary and secondary outcome measures are being collected at different time-points throughout the trial.
