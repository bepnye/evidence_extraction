Considering that buspirone is an anti-anxiety drug, this finding seems contradictory. Nevertheless, given that the majority of children in this study had comorbidity with the range of pervasive developmental disorder; therefore, the symptoms reported by parents about their children’s anxiety in some items of NCBRF can result from social interaction disorder and its caused self-isolation, but is not due to social anxiety. Some studies have revealed that risperidone decreases hyperactivity, irritability, and stereotypic behaviors in autistic disorder and also increases verbal communication that can result in the reduction of parental’ reports of anxiety behavior. </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="28391" xml_f="28392" txt_i="15121" txt_f="15122">
