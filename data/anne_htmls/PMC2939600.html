Yet the healthcare system often places the burden of accessing healthcare on the individual patient. While this task may be easy for healthy younger adults, the older, frail population encounters numerous obstacles, including difficulty recognizing important changes in status. In response, healthcare systems have attempted to preemptively evaluate at-risk patients prior to functional decline. These methods have included more frequent prescheduled outpatient physician visits, home phone calls from the physician office, home healthcare, and home visits by physicians or midlevel providers. While each of these methods has its advantages, they are labor- and time-intensive processes that may exacerbate the healthcare worker shortage</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="7638" xml_f="7639" txt_i="3293" txt_f="3294">2</offsets></sup><offsets xml_i="7645" xml_f="7990" txt_i="3294" txt_f="3639">. They also may miss the mark in caring for at-risk patients. Clearly, we need a more timely system of providing optimal care to chronically ill patients.

However, it remains unclear if home telemonitoring will reduce hospitalizations and ED visits in older patients with multiple medical problems. We propose to answer this question in a sample of high-risk adults at least 60 years of age with mixed chronic diseases in a randomized controlled trial. Our primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of home telemonitoring for reducing hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and the composite outcomes of hospitalizations and ED visits compared with usual care. Our secondary aims are to evaluate the effectiveness of home telemonitoring for improving functional status, quality of life, patient attitudes, behaviors, compliance, mood, and cognitive status compared with usual care. Furthermore, we intend to evaluate the effectiveness of home telemonitoring for decreasing total healthcare costs, 30-day re-hospitalization rates, and hospital bed days.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9288" xml_f="9302" txt_i="4835" txt_f="4849">Methods/Design</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="9322" xml_f="9334" txt_i="4850" txt_f="4862">Study design</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="9345" xml_f="10164" txt_i="4863" txt_f="5682">This multi-site, randomized controlled trial of home telemonitoring or usual care will take place in the four sites of the outpatient practice of Mayo Clinic's Division of Primary Care Internal Medicine (PCIM) in the Department of Family Medicine (FM) in Rochester, Minn. and nearby Kasson, Minn.

However, the clinical desire to provide more frequent and detailed monitoring of expanded physiologic parameters and to have a remote "face-to-face" interaction with the patient has lead to the development of more sophisticated telemonitoring equipment. This equipment provides direct visual and audio communication through video monitoring and expands the ability to frequently assess patient status via capabilities (e.g., oximetry, spirometry, direct vital sign measurement, remote auscultation, blood glucose measurement). It can be monitored in a synchronous fashion to facilitate early intervention.
