Two patients with good PS (PS = 1) were also included in the study as they were not exercising regularly and could not attend the usual hospital-based supervised training sessions. The majority of patients (73%) had metastatic (stage IV) disease. The most common tumour types were lung or gastrointestinal cancers, but five patients had other types of tumours including breast (n = 1), ovarian (n = 1), endometrial (n = 1) and haematological (n = 1) malignancy. One additional patient was being treated with cyclical intravenous chemotherapy for systemic amyloidosis without overt evidence of underlying malignancy. Overall 67% of the patients were undergoing active treatment with chemotherapy and 40% were taking, or had completed within the preceding 14 days, an extended (≥3 weeks’ duration) course of corticosteroids (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="20490" xml_f="20491" txt_i="15080" txt_f="15081">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20498" xml_f="20562" txt_i="15081" txt_f="15145">).

As a group, the patients in this study had impaired exercise capacity with mean 6 MWT of 257 m (50.2% predicted) and mean STS time of 8.0 s, which is 2.6 standard deviations above the mean expected in (i.e. slower than) healthy individuals of similar age (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2"><offsets xml_i="20898" xml_f="20899" txt_i="15410" txt_f="15411">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20906" xml_f="20908" txt_i="15411" txt_f="15413">).</offsets></p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="20949" xml_f="20957" txt_i="15414" txt_f="15422">Figure 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="20977" xml_f="21049" txt_i="15422" txt_f="15494">Breakdown of reasons for early and late withdrawals from the NMES study.</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-684X-13-23-1"></graphic></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label><offsets xml_i="21163" xml_f="21170" txt_i="15495" txt_f="15502">Table 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="21190" xml_f="21280" txt_i="15502" txt_f="15592">Demographic and disease characteristics of patients who underwent full baseline assessment</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col><col align="left"></col><col align="center"></col><col align="center"></col></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="21544" xml_f="21545" txt_i="15593" txt_f="15594"> </offsets><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="21592" xml_f="21593" txt_i="15594" txt_f="15595"> </offsets><hr></hr></th><th colspan="2" align="center" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="21660" xml_f="21681" txt_i="15595" txt_f="15616">All subjects (N = 15)</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="21737" xml_f="21738" txt_i="15616" txt_f="15617"> </offsets><hr></hr></th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="21794" xml_f="21795" txt_i="15617" txt_f="15618"> </offsets><hr></hr></th><th align="left" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="21842" xml_f="21843" txt_i="15618" txt_f="15619"> </offsets><hr></hr></th><th align="center" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="21898" xml_f="21916" txt_i="15619" txt_f="15637">Completed (N = 10)</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="center" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="21978" xml_f="21995" txt_i="15637" txt_f="15654">Withdrawn (N = 5)</offsets></bold><hr></hr></th><th align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="22051" xml_f="22052" txt_i="15654" txt_f="15655"> </offsets><hr></hr></th></tr><tr><th align="left"><offsets xml_i="22092" xml_f="22093" txt_i="15655" txt_f="15656"> </offsets></th><th align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="22123" xml_f="22132" txt_i="15656" txt_f="15665">Mean (SD)</offsets></bold></th><th align="left"><offsets xml_i="22161" xml_f="22162" txt_i="15665" txt_f="15666"> </offsets></th><th align="center"><offsets xml_i="22186" xml_f="22187" txt_i="15666" txt_f="15667"> </offsets></th><th align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="22217" xml_f="22218" txt_i="15667" txt_f="15668">P</offsets></bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="22306" xml_f="22313" txt_i="15668" txt_f="15675">Age yrs</offsets></bold><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="22369" xml_f="22379" txt_i="15676" txt_f="15686">67.9 (9.4)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="22428" xml_f="22439" txt_i="15687" txt_f="15698">67.6 (10.9)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="22488" xml_f="22498" txt_i="15699" txt_f="15709">68.4 (6.3)</offsets><hr></hr></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><offsets xml_i="22547" xml_f="22551" txt_i="15710" txt_f="15714">0.88</offsets><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><offsets xml_i="22613" xml_f="22633" txt_i="15715" txt_f="15735">Body mass index kg/m</offsets></bold><sup><offsets xml_i="22645" xml_f="22646" txt_i="15735" txt_f="15736">

Furthermore, qualitative feedback confirmed that home-based NMES is highly acceptable. There was a wide range in adherence with NMES over the 6-week period of intervention, but despite this, 70% of patients used the NMES for at least 40% of the available days. This equates to use at least three times a week, which is the usual frequency for standard exercise training programs. Repeated physical performance testing before and after NMES revealed wide intra-individual variability.

The primary study objective was to assess feasibility and acceptability of NMES in a variety of cancer patients and for this reason the patients recruited for the study had a range of pathological types and stages of cancer. However, as a result the study participants also had a widely varying initial functional status and exercise performance, making it more difficult to reliably detect functional changes attributable to NMES. We did not include an untreated control group to assess the likely spontaneous changes in outcome measures over the same time period. In debilitated advanced cancer patients, progressive physical deterioration may be anticipated. Thus a reasonable minimal expectation of successful NMES, and other exercise interventions, would be to inhibit this deterioration, rather than achieve an improvement from baseline. Without an untreated comparison group we are unable to say whether there was any indication of this beneficial effect of NMES in the current study. Due to limited personnel resources, the same physiotherapist who instructed the patient in the use of NMES also performed the outcomes assessments. This raises the possibility of patient response bias, particularly for reported global performance status and responses to questionnaire items.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44336" xml_f="44353" txt_i="24908" txt_f="24925">Maddocks et al.

Consistent with this notion, the data from this study did confirm that those patients recently treated with steroids had poorer function at baseline (6 MWT mean(SD): recent steroids 166(139)m vs no steroids 394(88)m, P = 0.04). However there was only a non-significant trend towards a differential improvement in 6 MWT in patients treated with extended courses of steroids. Nevertheless, further studies of NMES may be warranted to establish if early use of NMES can be of particular benefit in cancer patients treated with prolonged courses of steroids. Similarly, it is conceivable that other subgroups of cancer patients should be considered for more focused studies, including the more elderly patients with comorbidities [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"><offsets xml_i="50487" xml_f="50489" txt_i="30300" txt_f="30302">29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="50496" xml_f="50592" txt_i="30302" txt_f="30398">] and those being treated with antitumour agents, such as Sorafenib, which promote muscle loss [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"><offsets xml_i="50624" xml_f="50626" txt_i="30398" txt_f="30400">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="50633" xml_f="50635" txt_i="30400" txt_f="30402">].</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="50680" xml_f="50691" txt_i="30404" txt_f="30415">Conclusions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="50702" xml_f="51642" txt_i="30416" txt_f="31356">The results of the current pilot study suggest that NMES is both feasible and acceptable in a mixed group of patients with cancer, most of whom had poor performance status. This study does not demonstrate that NMES leads to improved physical functioning in cancer patients with poor performance status despite the success of NMES in other chronic diseases and clinical settings. One reason for the difficulty in detecting functional benefits of NMES in cancer patients may be their marked heterogeneity in terms of medical status and physical functioning. As a result, though it is likely that NMES has a role in achieving or maintaining optimal functional ability in selected patients with cancer, this still remains to be confirmed by future prospective studies. Such studies should be designed to both identify the best candidates for NMES interventions and to confirm the optimal method of delivery of this type of therapeutic exercise.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="51664" xml_f="51677" txt_i="31358" txt_f="31371">Abbreviations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="51688" xml_f="51982" txt_i="31372" txt_f="31666">6MWT: Six-minute walk test; CHF: Congestive heart failure; CNR-JGH: The McGill Cancer Nutrition-Rehabilitation Program clinic at the Jewish General Hospital; COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; NMES: Neuromuscular electrical stimulation; PS: Performance status; STS: Sit-to-stand test.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="52004" xml_f="52023" txt_i="31668" txt_f="31687">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="52034" xml_f="52323" txt_i="31688" txt_f="31977">RTJ has received payments as an advisory board member for NEOMED and lecturer fees from Abbott Laboratories.
