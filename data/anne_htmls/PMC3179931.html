In this study, 21,860 patients from 11 health centers in Eastern Massachusetts were randomized to receive a mailing that included a tailored letter, an educational brochure, a dedicated telephone number to schedule a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and an FOBT kit. Participants that were still overdue for CRC screening 6 months after initial enrollment of the study received a mailed reminder. The cost of the intervention was $5.48 per patient and the ICER was $94 per additional patient screened. Although the study showed promising results, the intervention could only be applied in a large integrated medical group with a well-established electronic health record. In addition, the improvement in screening rates was about one half of what we observed in our study, and as a result, the ICER was much higher than what we report. Similar to our study, although not related to FOBT adherence, Shankaran et al. were able to show that a 1-page, 2-sided mailed reminder significantly increased colonoscopy appointment adherence by 12% and had an ICER of $43 per additional person screened for CRC [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27"><offsets xml_i="42008" xml_f="42010" txt_i="26049" txt_f="26051">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42017" xml_f="42191" txt_i="26051" txt_f="26225">].

With rising costs of health care, one should consider if available, information technology systems that could generate mailed reminders from electronic medical records.

First, our study was a cost-effectiveness analysis with an intermediate outcome (cost per additional person screened for CRC). We did not use the standard metric for cost-effectiveness, which is the cost per year of life saved. The goal of our study was to increase the utilization of FOBT, a CRC screening method that has already been shown to be cost-effective. We understand that cost-effectiveness ratios do not provide a definitive answer, but it can assist the decision maker in choosing the most appropriate intervention given the cost, effectiveness, and resources available to implement the program. Secondly, our sample was comprised of U.S. Veteran patients from San Diego, California, which limits the generalizability of our findings. More studies are needed at other VA medical centers, community based medical centers, and non-VA settings to help establish the intervention's generalizibility. Third, our study was based on an analysis from the payer perspective, and costs incurred by individual patients were not included in the analysis. Fortunately, FOBT costs to the patient are negligible in that the patient can perform the test quickly in his or her home with minimal discomfort or complications. Lastly, we did not exclude any patients over the age of 75 as recommended by the USPSTF in 2008 [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="45124" xml_f="45125" txt_i="28992" txt_f="28993">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45132" xml_f="45198" txt_i="28993" txt_f="29059">], because our study was performed prior to these recommendations.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="45220" xml_f="45230" txt_i="29061" txt_f="29071">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="45241" xml_f="45767" txt_i="29072" txt_f="29598">In conclusion, a simple mailed educational reminder increased FOBT card return rate at a cost many health care systems can afford.
