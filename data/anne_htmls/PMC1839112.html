This was a post hoc analysis of data collected prospectively during a small, single centre trial. The study was not specifically designed to test the association between potential cardiac risk factors and post-operative myocardial injury. The low incidence of post-operative myocardial injury identified in this study may explain the fact that only one potential risk factor for myocardial injury was associated with an elevation in troponin T concentration. Acute myocardial ischaemia was a specific exclusion criterion, but no attempts were made to standardise cardiac medications prior to surgery or stratify patients for the presence of myocardial disease. There were no overall differences in pre-operative cardiac medication or co-morbidity. However, five patients in the control group were taking digoxin prior to surgery compared to none in the GDT group. The indications for these prescriptions are not known. The use of cardiac troponins appears to be a very reliable method of identifying post-operative myocardial injury [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><offsets xml_i="18090" xml_f="18091" txt_i="12936" txt_f="12937">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18098" xml_f="18099" txt_i="12937" txt_f="12938">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="18131" xml_f="18133" txt_i="12938" txt_f="12940">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18140" xml_f="18292" txt_i="12940" txt_f="13092">].
