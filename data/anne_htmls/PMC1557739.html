Although newer modes of therapy are being applied, traditional therapy involving surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, followed by long-term antioestrogen therapy continues to be used. Immunotherapy could be a useful adjunct to conventional therapy, particularly in an adjuvant setting and (as shown here) in patients with early disease and no metastasis. New therapeutic procedures in breast cancer are usually tried in patients with advanced disease, who may be appropriate candidates for cytotoxic drugs. However, such patients may be unable to respond appropriately to immunotherapy, given that an intact and competent immune system is required to induce a therapeutic immune response.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7599" xml_f="8099" txt_i="2340" txt_f="2840">Treatment of cancer with immunotherapy has been the goal of many researchers since the advent of effective immunization against infectious diseases. Previously, tumour antigens were not easily identified, but currently identified antigens include glycoproteins and glycolipids (for example, gangliosides), developmental and over-expressed antigens (for example, CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), gp75, MAGE, tyrosinase, melan-A, mucin [MUC]1), and mutated oncogenes (for example, p53, HER-2/neu, ras) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="8130" xml_f="8131" txt_i="2840" txt_f="2841">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8138" xml_f="8746" txt_i="2841" txt_f="3449">]. Our laboratory has focused on MUC1 as a target for tumour immunotherapy. Mucins (such as MUC1) are high-molecular-weight glycoproteins that are secreted by many epithelial cells such as breast, ovary, colon and pancreatic carcinomas. MUC1 is of interest and a potential target for tumour immunotherapy for the following reasons: there is an up to 100-fold increase in the amount of mucin present on cancer cells compared with normal cells; MUC1 has a ubiquitous rather than focal cellular distribution; and MUC1 has altered glycosylation, revealing peptide epitopes not easily identified in normal mucins.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8753" xml_f="9177" txt_i="3450" txt_f="3874">Cloning of the cDNA for MUC1 and definition of the structure revealed that the molecule is transmembranous, with a relatively large extracellular domain and a cytoplasmic tail.

Unfortunately, most cancer trials involve patients with advanced disease, selected on the basis of traditional therapy involving toxic chemotherapeutic agents. However, such patients are likely to have poor immune responses, significant tumour bulk, limited time for the induction and effector phases of specific immunity, and are the least likely to have therapeutic benefit from immunotherapy regimens. We do not advocate abandonment of the traditional approach of phase I studies, in which the primary end-point is assessment of toxicity, but we do recommend that these pilot studies of immunotherapeutic agents be quickly followed by larger studies in patients with early disease.
