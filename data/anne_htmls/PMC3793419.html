There was also a significant improvement in the mouth opening and in the movement of the tongue (clinical grade 5). The histopathological findings also showed a marked reduction in the inflammatory cell infiltrate and density of collagen fibrils. The mechanism by which colchicine improved the clinical status of OSF patients in our study was difficult to ascertain since the drug was used in combination with Hyaluronidase. Also since this was the first study where cochicine had been used in the treatment of OSF, we could not compare our results. However, we attributed them to the effect of colchicine which is both an anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory agent. Like IFN-γ, colchicine also reduces collagen synthesis, down regulates fibroblast proliferation and upregulates anti-fibrotic cytokine and collagenase synthesis in the basal layer of the epithelium and lamina propria.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16"><offsets xml_i="19462" xml_f="19464" txt_i="13137" txt_f="13139">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19471" xml_f="19786" txt_i="13139" txt_f="13454">] One of our patients, however, showed relapse of the restricted mouth opening during the follow-up of 6 months after the cessation of treatment.
