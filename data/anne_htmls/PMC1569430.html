If, on the other hand, the patient did not prefer larval therapy over hydrogel with an 8 week difference in time to healing, then decreasing times to healing with the use of larval therapy were presented, i.e. healing at 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 and 6 weeks (increasing effect sizes from 9 to 14 weeks).

Furthermore, we found that participants were willing to have a much smaller median difference in time to healing than the six weeks proposed by clinicians, and used in the original sample size for the study. As such, researchers were able to feel confident in the patient acceptability of the intervention as the original sample size proposed greater differences in time to healing than that proposed by participants.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="18115" xml_f="18624" txt_i="12291" txt_f="12800">We found that using a relatively simple, interviewer administered questionnaire we could elicit meaningful information on the effect size for an intervention from participants. This method has the potential to elicit information to be used in sample size calculations for randomised trials in cases where there is concern over the patient acceptability of a therapy. It would be useful to repeat this exercise for interventions that may have significant drawbacks to the patient as well as potential benefits.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18646" xml_f="18665" txt_i="12802" txt_f="12821">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18676" xml_f="18736" txt_i="12822" txt_f="12882">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18758" xml_f="18780" txt_i="12884" txt_f="12906">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18791" xml_f="19104" txt_i="12907" txt_f="13220">SOM, CI and EAN contributed to the study protocol and questionnaire, KS conducted the interviews and collected data, ESP, SOM, CI and DJT analysed the data, ESP drafted the manuscript, SOM, KS, CI, EAN and DJT provided critical feedback on the manuscript.
