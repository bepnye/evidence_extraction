We could not find any study related to the effect of clonidine on postoperative shivering in patients with opium addiction and we suggest that our study is a unique survey about this matter which showed that oral clonidine in patients with opium addiction can control the incidence of post op shivering. Clonidine premedication was found to decrease the recovery time after operation in both patients with and without opium addiction and even the magnitude of the difference between clonidine and placebo was higher in opium addicted than non-addicted patients. So, from our results we deducted that premedication effect of clonidine on post anesthesia recovery time in patients with opium addiction is better than patients without addiction and by considering the effectiveness of clonidine premedication on recovery time after anesthesia, recommendation about oral administration of clonidine as premedication in patients with opium addiction is reasonable. Some studies have shown that clonidine premedication does not delay recovery time after anesthesia (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A7143R21"><offsets xml_i="22113" xml_f="22115" txt_i="11278" txt_f="11280">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22122" xml_f="22124" txt_i="11280" txt_f="11282">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A7143R22"><offsets xml_i="22161" xml_f="22163" txt_i="11282" txt_f="11284">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22170" xml_f="22310" txt_i="11284" txt_f="11424">) but in other ones clonidine as premedication drug can delay arousal from anesthesia and extend the time of discharge from operating room (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A7143R23"><offsets xml_i="22347" xml_f="22349" txt_i="11424" txt_f="11426">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22356" xml_f="22358" txt_i="11426" txt_f="11428">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A7143R24"><offsets xml_i="22395" xml_f="22397" txt_i="11428" txt_f="11430">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="22404" xml_f="23466" txt_i="11430" txt_f="12492">). Through our investigation we could not find any related article about clonidine effects on recovery time after anesthesia in opium abuser patients so, we suppose that our study upon the effectiveness of clonidine on recovery time after anesthesia in patients with opium addiction is a unique study on this matter. We could not have equal sexes of patients and the male ones were dominant in the study. So, it seems that we cannot generalize our results to both sexes. The other limitation was that we did not have any lab data about the level of opium in patients’ serum or urine and we relied on the history of patients about their addiction. It was due to an attempt to preserve patients’ rights and we did not intend to create any discomfort for patients to have any test about their addiction. In summary, the premedication of oral clonidine can be effective to decrease the incidence of shivering after operation in both patients with and without opium addiction and to decrease recovery time after anesthesia especially in patients with opium addiction.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge all the nurses of anesthesia in Imam Hossein Medical Center who did their best to perform this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="afn2017" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:</bold> The resurch of this survey will be used in all medical centers wich all kinds of operations have been performanced.</p></fn><fn id="afn2018" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Please cite this paper as:</bold> Jabbary Moghaddam M, Ommi D, Mirkheshti A, Dabbagh A, Memary E, Sadeghi A, et al.
