It requires neither anticoagulant nor bovine thrombin. This is produced in a totally natural manner, without using anticoagulant during blood harvest nor bovine thrombin and calcium chloride for platelet activation and fibrin polymerization. It has eliminated the redundant process of adding anticoagulant as well as the need to neutralize it. The absence of anticoagulant implies the activation in a few minutes of most platelets of the blood sample in contact with the tube walls and release of the coagulation cascades. The protocol is very simple and of low cost. PRF is a matrix of autologous fibrin, in which are embedded intrinsically a large quantity of platelet and leukocyte cytokines during centrifugation leading to their progressive release over time (7-11 days), as the network of fibrin disintegrates.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8"><offsets xml_i="7838" xml_f="7839" txt_i="4128" txt_f="4129">8</offsets></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9"><offsets xml_i="7879" xml_f="7880" txt_i="4129" txt_f="4130">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7887" xml_f="7888" txt_i="4130" txt_f="4131">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7895" xml_f="8061" txt_i="4132" txt_f="4298">Therefore, the aim of the present study was to clinically compare autologous PRF combined with DFDBA to DFDBA alone in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title><offsets xml_i="8124" xml_f="8145" txt_i="4300" txt_f="4321">MATERIALS AND METHODS</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8156" xml_f="8528" txt_i="4322" txt_f="4694">In this 6 month follow-up interventional study, a total of 10 systemically healthy patients undergoing periodontal therapy at the Department of Periodontology, Govt.

PRF consists of a fibrin matrix polymerised in a tetramolecular structure; the incorporation of platelets, leukocytes, and cytokines; and circulating stem cells. Slow fibrin polymerization during PRF processing leads to the intrinsic incorporation of platelet cytokines and glycan chains in the fibrin meshes. This result implies that PRF, unlike the other platelet concentrates, is able to progressively release cytokines during fibrin matrix remodeling.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16"><offsets xml_i="23762" xml_f="23764" txt_i="16363" txt_f="16365">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23771" xml_f="24335" txt_i="16365" txt_f="16929">] It is also found that PRF organizes as a dense fibrin scaffold with a high number of leukocytes concentrated in one part of the clot. Leukocytes seem to have a strong influence on growth factor release, immune regulation, anti-infectious activity, and matrix remodeling during healing. It is an optimal matrix for migration of endothelial cells and fibroblasts. It permits a rapid angiogenesis and an easier remodeling of fibrin in a more resistant connective tissue.
