potential for overdiagnosis of breast cancer due to screening. However, no consensus has
been reached on the extent of such overdiagnosis. An overdiagnosed breast cancer is
defined as one which is screen-detected, and would never have presented clinically in a

In summary, a randomised controlled trial was designed to assess the
effectiveness of annual screening by mammography in women from age 40 onwards in the
UK. The trial comprised of an intervention arm of 53,890 women assigned to annual
screening invitation and a control arm of 106,971 women not offered screening.
Recruitment began in 1991 and the trial included 23 centres. Women were invited each
year, except for those who specified that they did not wish to participate in the
trial. Two-view mammography was performed on the first attendance to screening. The
following screens were single view unless otherwise indicated. All diagnosed breast
cancers, including interval, screen-detected, and those in the control arm, were
recorded and submitted to a pathologic review.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10850" xml_f="11859" txt_i="6477" txt_f="7486">Women with diagnosed breast cancer at entry to the trial were excluded from this

were included only if they attended all previous screening rounds. Only screening
episodes recorded from ages 40 to 49 years as part of the trial were considered, and
the analysis was limited to the first eight screening invitations since few women
received more than this number. The exact date of each screen and of any breast
cancer diagnosis was known for each woman. Interval cancers were defined as cancers
diagnosed up to 12 months after a negative routine screen, and time since the
previous negative screen was calculated in months. In all eight screening rounds, a

For the breast cancer incidence in
women aged 40 to 44, we used incidence rates reported by ONS. For women aged 44 to
49, ONS incidence rates are affected by screening at age 49; we therefore used the
incidence in the control arm of the Age trial, adjusted by the ratio of the ONS rates
to Age trial rates for the 40 to 44 age group. This resulted in higher incidence
rates than those observed in the Age trial control arm; it was therefore not
necessary to adjust these rates for selection bias due to the lower observed rate in
non-attenders. For the base-case analysis, the medians of our MST and STS estimates
were used. We also performed sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of
changing MST and STS on the estimate of overdiagnosis. We considered the following
scenarios: high MST, low MST, high STS, low STS, high MST with low STS, and high MST
