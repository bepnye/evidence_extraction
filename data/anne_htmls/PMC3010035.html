First, three of five patients given mitoxantrone who had high minimal residual disease at the first timepoint and who were not transplanted for various reasons had recurrence. Thus, in the group with high minimal residual disease, sustained remission probably needs both mitoxantrone and allo-SCT. Second, although idarubicin was more toxic than mitoxantrone, this toxic effect was mainly seen during the first 8 weeks of treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="31019" xml_f="31552" txt_i="20827" txt_f="21360">For the few patients who were not transplanted and continued on chemotherapy, haematological toxic effects increased during the later phases in the mitoxantrone group. Thus, mitoxantrone might in some way affect the haemopoietic stem-cell niche, making it a less favourable environment for the leukaemic cell and more conducive to the allograft. Further analyses of the effects of mitoxantrone on malignant and normal cells are needed. Such studies have the potential to identify novel mechanisms for the eradication of this disease.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="31559" xml_f="31651" txt_i="21361" txt_f="21453">A randomised trial of mitoxantrone was previously done in childhood acute myeloid leukaemia.</offsets><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="31690" xml_f="31692" txt_i="21453" txt_f="21455">34</offsets></sup></xref><offsets xml_i="31705" xml_f="31912" txt_i="21455" txt_f="21662"> Results showed an improved disease-free survival and lower relapse rates in the mitoxantrone group compared with the daunorubicin group; however, these reduced rates did not translate into overall survival.</offsets><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup><offsets xml_i="31951" xml_f="31953" txt_i="21662" txt_f="21664">34</offsets></sup></xref><offsets xml_i="31966" xml_f="33065" txt_i="21664" txt_f="22763"> Mitoxantrone has only been infrequently used in therapeutic trials in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. A perception that optimisation has been reached with available drugs has shifted focus towards newer drugs and targeted therapy. These drugs will be prohibitively expensive for many patients. Mitoxantrone is a cheap and readily available drug and clearly needs further clinical assessment in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Most frontline protocols are now moving towards risk-stratifying treatment based on minimal residual disease after induction. Patients with positive minimal residual disease usually receive anthracycline-containing delayed intensification blocks. Logically, assessment of the potential benefit of mitoxantrone in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia would be in a randomised use of mitoxantrone in the delayed intensification phase of frontline treatment for high-risk patients. Our results suggest that, while we wait for targeted therapies to become a reality, conventional cytotoxics still have a role in treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group

was funded in part by a programme grant from Cancer Research UK (VS); grants from the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research funded in part the analysis of minimal residual disease (NGo) and the Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Group (AVM). The Cancer Council NSW and Sporting Chance Cancer Foundation funded analysis of minimal residual disease at CCIA (RS). MRD standardisation and quality control were supported by EuroMRD. The trial was initially sponsored by the Barts and the London NHS Trust (2003–6) and then by the University of Leicester NHS Trust (2006–09). In the UK, assessments of minimal residual disease were done at the UK MRD Network Laboratories (Barts, Bristol, Glasgow, Sheffield). We thank the participating children and their families and the physicians who enrolled their patients into the study. Marita Marshall, Helen Crowne, John Fox, and members of the Cancer Research UK IS team helped to design and run the database. We thank the members of the Data Monitoring Committee—namely, Mike Stevens, Moira Stewart, and Rob Edwards, as well as Tim Eden, Shekhar Krishnan, Louise Cheesman, and Anita Lim for their contributions. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Tony Oakhill, who pioneered the management of relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in the UK.</p></sec></ack><ack><title>Contributors</title><p>VS conceived and designed the study with the help of SL. VS designed the database with the help of Cancer Research UK Information Systems. VS, PD, TR, MM, and PA were trial coordinators. CP, AM, NGr, and CL were responsible for trial data management. CP, VS, RW, and SL analysed data. JH, NGo, and RS were responsible for minimal residual disease and AVM for cytogenetics. CP, AM, RW, and VS wrote the paper and all others reviewed the final draft.

Risk groups: very early refers to less than 18 months from first diagnosis; early refers to 18 months or more after first diagnosis and less than 6 months from stopping therapy; and late refers to 6 months or more after stopping therapy. (B) MRD sampling TPs are marked. At TP1, standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients with MRD lower than 10<sup>−4</sup> cells were ineligible, and high-risk and intermediate-risk patients with MRD of 10<sup>−4</sup> cells or more were eligible for allo-SCT. Localised radiotherapy was given to those with extramedullary disease and not proceeding to allo-SCT. When MRD assessment was not possible in intermediate-risk patients, allo-SCT was allowed provided relapse occurred within 24 months of stopping therapy.
