Only one recording was used from any single office visit. If there was more than one recording at a given visit, the last measurement recorded for that visit was used. These visits ranged from several weeks to several months apart, depending on the practice of the physician regarding follow-up of hypertensive patients. If the mean of these three readings, taken at different visits, was ≥140/90, the patient was labeled as 'uncontrolled' by office measurement, meaning that the patient had not achieved the treatment target (≥130/80 was used for diabetics).

However there are some limitations. The BpTRU and ABPM were carried out in a research setting not a true clinical setting. All the patients had uncontrolled blood pressure according to office BP measurements, so it does not represent a full spectrum; it does not include normotensive patients or patients where the chart records suggest target has been achieved. The data was collected in the course of another study. There is a need for a study that sets out, a priori, to compared BpTRU with ABPM in the full spectrum of patients, and which follows those patients for a longer term to assess clinical outcomes.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23855" xml_f="23865" txt_i="15367" txt_f="15377">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23876" xml_f="24487" txt_i="15378" txt_f="15989">The control of hypertension is vital to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, however the current recommended BP targets are often not being met. There is also growing evidence that office measured sphygmomanometer-based blood pressures are unreliable and do not predict outcomes as well as ABPM, whereas there is increasing evidence from prospective trials that 24 hour monitoring has prognostic significance. We have shown that the BpTRU has potential to be used in the clinic setting to help overcome the difficulties caused by the WCE without the cost of having to conduct frequent 24 hour ABPMs.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24494" xml_f="25177" txt_i="15990" txt_f="16673">Although this study demonstrates that the BpTRU has a sensitivity and specificity that are not ideal when compared to the ABPM device we used, it is superior to usual office measurement and can be used by clinicians as part of their strategy for determining whether BP target has been achieved. We suggest that the BpTRU be used to adjust treatment until patient's BpTRU pressure is below 135/85 mmHg and then a 24 hour ABPM be conducted to confirm. ABPM measurement is not practical as a means of monitoring targets after each medication adjustment but in conjunction with the BpTRU can form the basis for clinical decisions that will promote more effective control of hypertension.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="25199" xml_f="25218" txt_i="16675" txt_f="16694">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="25229" xml_f="25289" txt_i="16695" txt_f="16755">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="25311" xml_f="25333" txt_i="16757" txt_f="16779">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="25344" xml_f="25536" txt_i="16780" txt_f="16972">LB abstracted the data from the larger baseline dataset from the randomized controlled trials.
