Normally, in each breath, 500 ml of air enter the lungs, and then it goes out of the lungs after the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. With deep breathing, the amount of air can be increased largely. These breathing exercises bring the air volume to 2500 ml in each breath. Therefore, by breathing exercises, more air will enter the lungs, arterial blood oxygen saturation will increase, and respiratory proper functioning will be possible, which promotes deep breathing improvement (</offsets><xref rid="A8986R11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="31388" xml_f="31390" txt_i="13994" txt_f="13996">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31397" xml_f="31399" txt_i="13996" txt_f="13998">, </offsets><xref rid="A8986R25" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="31436" xml_f="31438" txt_i="13998" txt_f="14000">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31445" xml_f="31447" txt_i="14000" txt_f="14002">, </offsets><xref rid="A8986R26" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="31484" xml_f="31486" txt_i="14002" txt_f="14004">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="31493" xml_f="31752" txt_i="14004" txt_f="14263">).

The nocturnal enuresis is more common in children with the oral breathing. It appears that the relative hypoxia in these children causes low-pressure oxygen in the distal tubes of kidney, unresponsiveness to the anti-diuretic hormone, and increased production of urine temporarily, particularly during the sleep. Both of these factors can increase the volume of urine, and consequently make the urine control more difficult and finally lead to the nocturnal enuresis ( </offsets><xref rid="A8986R3" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34242" xml_f="34244" txt_i="16140" txt_f="16142">3 </offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34251" xml_f="34253" txt_i="16142" txt_f="16144">, </offsets><xref rid="A8986R7" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="34289" xml_f="34291" txt_i="16144" txt_f="16146">7 </offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34298" xml_f="34796" txt_i="16146" txt_f="16644">).
