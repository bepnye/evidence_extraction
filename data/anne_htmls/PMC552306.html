Differences in each group's response to therapy appear to suggest that improved gait function may be due to different neuromuscular adaptations resulting from the different interventions. The TC group's improvements were associated with reorganized lower extremity neuromuscular patterns, which appear to promote a faster gait and reduced excessive hip compensation. The VR group's improvements, however, were not the result of lower extremity neuromuscular pattern changes. Lower-extremity MEE increases corresponded to attenuated forward trunk linear and angular movement in the VR group, suggesting better control of upper body motion to minimize loss of balance. These data support a growing body of evidence that Tai Chi may be a valuable complementary treatment for vestibular disorders.</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6903" xml_f="6913" txt_i="2468" txt_f="2478">Background</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6924" xml_f="7020" txt_i="2479" txt_f="2575">Vestibulopathy decreases whole body dynamic postural control and causes functional limitations [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><offsets xml_i="7051" xml_f="7052" txt_i="2575" txt_f="2576">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7059" xml_f="7060" txt_i="2576" txt_f="2577">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="7091" xml_f="7092" txt_i="2577" txt_f="2578">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7099" xml_f="7245" txt_i="2578" txt_f="2724">].

All treatment sessions included time to: 1) review material introduced in prior sessions; 2) introduce new material; 3) ask questions and share personal experiences or concerns regarding the practices; and 4) cool down and rest.</offsets></p><sec><title><offsets xml_i="16885" xml_f="16905" txt_i="11026" txt_f="11046">Tai Chi intervention</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="16916" xml_f="17041" txt_i="11047" txt_f="11172">The TC intervention incorporated three objectives outlined in a balance-related TC program developed by Wolf and colleagues [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="17073" xml_f="17075" txt_i="11172" txt_f="11174">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17082" xml_f="17083" txt_i="11174" txt_f="11175">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17"><offsets xml_i="17115" xml_f="17117" txt_i="11175" txt_f="11177">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17124" xml_f="17783" txt_i="11177" txt_f="11836">]. First, it emphasized movements that are easily comprehensible. Second, the sequence of exercises introduced reflected a progression that increasingly challenges postural stability, with a shift in weight bearing from bilateral to unilateral support. Third, the program emphasized increasing the magnitude of trunk and arm rotation while diminishing the base of support. The five specific TC movements employed in this study – 'raising the power', 'withdraw and push', 'wave hand like clouds', 'brush knee twist step', and 'separate right and left legs' – are described and illustrated in a training manual for the Cheng Man-Ch'ing's Yang-style short form [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28"><offsets xml_i="17815" xml_f="17817" txt_i="11836" txt_f="11838">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17824" xml_f="18569" txt_i="11838" txt_f="12583">]. In addition to these five formal TC movements, the intervention also included a short set of traditional TC warm-up exercises focused on loosening up the physical body and incorporating mindfulness and imagery into movement. Warm-up exercises included: gentle stretches sequentially targeting the shoulders, necks, arms and legs; a torso stretching exercise that coordinated weight shifts with rotations of the trunk and passive arm swinging; and a 5 minute seated meditation emphasizing relaxed diaphragmatic breathing. Approximately 20 minutes of each class was devoted to warm-up exercises, of which 10–12 minutes was spent in standing. Following an additional 40 minutes of formal TC practice, 10 minutes was allowed for group discussion.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="18591" xml_f="18629" txt_i="12585" txt_f="12623">Vestibular rehabilitation intervention</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="18640" xml_f="18822" txt_i="12624" txt_f="12806">The VR intervention used in this study was a comprehensive exercise program designed to improve the problems specifically associated with damage to the peripheral vestibular system [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><offsets xml_i="18853" xml_f="18854" txt_i="12806" txt_f="12807">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18861" xml_f="18862" txt_i="12807" txt_f="12808">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="18893" xml_f="18894" txt_i="12808" txt_f="12809">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18901" xml_f="18902" txt_i="12809" txt_f="12810">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><offsets xml_i="18934" xml_f="18936" txt_i="12810" txt_f="12812">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18943" xml_f="18944" txt_i="12812" txt_f="12813">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"><offsets xml_i="18976" xml_f="18978" txt_i="12813" txt_f="12815">29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18985" xml_f="20195" txt_i="12815" txt_f="14025">]. Each treatment session focused on the three main objectives of the VR intervention. Firstly, a series of eye-head coordination exercises were performed to promote gaze stability during both quiet standing and dynamic functional activities (such as combining movement of an image across the retina with head movement). Subjects progressed to performing these eye-head exercises with the target on a more complex background (to simulate real world activities), at increasingly faster speeds of head movements (eg, 2–3 Hz), and during more dynamic standing and locomotor activities. A second treatment objective included VOR training in a group format with subjects standing. Target foveation objects (words of various sizes) were fixed to a large checkerboard background covering one wall of the exercise room, enabling us to provide the appropriate visual stimuli. Patients were progressed by increasing the speed (frequency and amplitude) of head movement to train the VOR more appropriately at speeds consistent with everyday locomotor activities. The third main component of the VR program was upright balance retraining exercises that enhance the use of various sensory cues for gaining posture control [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="20226" xml_f="20227" txt_i="14025" txt_f="14026">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20234" xml_f="20235" txt_i="14026" txt_f="14027">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29"><offsets xml_i="20267" xml_f="20269" txt_i="14027" txt_f="14029">29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20276" xml_f="20277" txt_i="14029" txt_f="14030">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"><offsets xml_i="20309" xml_f="20311" txt_i="14030" txt_f="14032">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20318" xml_f="21236" txt_i="14032" txt_f="14950">]. Examples of these exercises include subjects maintaining their balance while decreasing their base of support (such as standing on one foot, marching or walking heel to toe) and while walking on various floor surfaces (such as the pliable surfaces of a foam mat). Subjects were further challenged by incorporating head and trunk movements or with eyes closed during standing and walking exercises. All exercises were performed in an upright position (either standing or during locomotion) based on individual tolerance. If required, a seat was provided and the exercise performed in a seated position until the subject was able to tolerate the activity in standing. Each group treatment session lasted 60 minutes allowing 20 minutes for each of the 3 main exercise components. There was an additional 10 minutes for questions and answer time and for assistance with individual progression of home exercise programs.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="21264" xml_f="21277" txt_i="14953" txt_f="14966">Gait analysis</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="21288" xml_f="21914" txt_i="14967" txt_f="15593">Subjects performed two-to-four gait trials along a 10 m level walkway at baseline testing, and at testing following the intervention program, at their freely selected pace upon the command "Please walk as you normally would, as if taking a brisk walk in the park".

Similar relationships were also observed between change in leg MEE and change in peak forward trunk velocity. The observed direct relationship for the TC group suggests that the redistribution of power among ankle, knee and hip joints, which resulted in a net increase in the total MEE of the leg, enabled these patients to attain a faster gait. This observation is expected based on the principles of TC, which emphasize a vertical alignment integrating the head, torso, hips and legs. This concept of integrated alignment is reflected in phrases from the TC classics such as ". suspend the spine like a necklace of pearls" and "movements are initiated in the feet, steered by the waist and administered through the hands."

In contrast, for the VR group, however, the increase in leg MEE was associated with a decrease in both peak and range of trunk velocity. This finding suggests that VR subjects, when increasing power generation/absorption with their lower extremities, reduce trunk oscillations during gait, possibly as a way to stabilize the trunk and head. This corrective procedure may not be necessary for TC subjects as they learned to move the trunk more proportionately to total lower extremity MEE, without need to explicitly attend to additional factors or mechanisms to stabilize the head. Although speculative, these scenarios correspond with the observed high positive correlation between change in leg MEE and change in trunk velocity peak and range seen after TC training but not after VR rehabilitation.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45093" xml_f="45232" txt_i="33902" txt_f="34041">Because the VR exercise program may increase subjects' awareness of eye and head movement strategies that cause dizziness and instability [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"><offsets xml_i="45263" xml_f="45264" txt_i="34041" txt_f="34042">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45271" xml_f="45272" txt_i="34042" txt_f="34043">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47"><offsets xml_i="45304" xml_f="45306" txt_i="34043" txt_f="34045">47</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45313" xml_f="45550" txt_i="34045" txt_f="34282">], a more rigid head and trunk strategy during dynamic activities such as gait would be expected.

Subjects practice maintaining balance in challenging postures (narrow base of support such as feet together and one-legged standing still) using a variety of self selected movement patterns. It is probable that subjects would make the trunk more rigid to lessen head movement during these tasks. The VR group's decrease in trunk velocity range with increase in mechanical energy of the lower extremities during gait appears to support this explanation. Within the TC group, the subjects practice series of movement patterns that include elements of controlled trunk rotation without instruction on eye fixation. The training of smoothly transitioning body segment motions may provide these subjects a different mode of compensation for their instability.

Our small sample size was perhaps the most important limitation. It is probable that the lack of between-group significant changes, particularly in light of many significant within group differences (pre-post intervention), was due to high variances obscuring group mean differences. Indeed, a larger sample size for controlling type II errors (increasing power), and better control of type I errors for multiple statistical tests, is warranted for future full-scale studies. The large age range within groups may have also contributed to high variability, but note that more heterogeneous samples in fact enhance external validity, including generalizability, of the results. We also did not include a no-treatment control group in the experimental design of this preliminary study. Because vestibulopathic patients may learn to compensate spontaneously, a no-treatment or sham-treatment group would be necessary to determine if changes in gait function are truly a result of the interventions. This is unlikely, however, given the inclusion criteria that all subjects must have had stable symptoms for 6 months and were on average 3 year post-onset of vestibulopathy.

As well, we only analyzed the mechanics of the lower extremities in the sagittal plane. It is highly likely that compensations for lower limb power impairments occurred in frontal and transverse planes as well.

Although there were no significant differences in proportion of UVH and BVH between the two treatment groups, that the BVH patients were much more disabled than the UVH patients in this study may be important, even when the difference in proportions of diagnostic categories (BVH or UVH) within treatment groups is small.
