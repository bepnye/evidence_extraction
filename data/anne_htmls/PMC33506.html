If a treatment as simple as short term corticosteroids produces just a moderate benefit, this could be worthwhile. For example, if corticosteroids reduced the risk of death by just 2% (e.g. from 15% to 13%), and reduced the risk of permanent disability by a similar amount, then treatment of 500,000 patients would avoid 10,000 deaths and prevent 10,000 permanent disabilities. But, such a benefit would be impossible to demonstrate reliably without large scale randomised evidence. If, for example, 10,000 patients were randomly allocated to receive a corticosteroid infusion and 10,000 a placebo infusion, then a reduction from 15% to 13% dead should be detectable - and a reduction from 15% to 12% would certainly be detectable. By contrast, a trial involving only 2,000 patients would probably miss such differences.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="5686" xml_f="5898" txt_i="2776" txt_f="2988">So far, all of the randomised trials of corticosteroids in head injury have been small: the largest included only a few hundred patients, and even in aggregate they have involved only about 2,000 patients (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="5930" xml_f="5931" txt_i="2988" txt_f="2989">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5938" xml_f="5941" txt_i="2989" txt_f="2992">) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><offsets xml_i="5972" xml_f="5973" txt_i="2992" txt_f="2993">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="5980" xml_f="6717" txt_i="2993" txt_f="3730">]. When all previous trials are combined, the risk of death in the corticosteroid treated group appears to be about 2% lower than in the control group, but the 95% confidence interval runs from 6% lower to 2% higher mortality. (This overall reduction from 39% dead to 37% dead corresponds to an 'odds ratio' of 0.91, with 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 1.12; the corresponding odds ratio for death or disability in those trials is 0.90, with 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.11.) Hence, the overall result from the previous trials is compatible with there being no real benefit, but it is also easily compatible with a benefit of a few percent. However, the existing trials are too small to demonstrate or to refute either possibility.</offsets></p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label><offsets xml_i="6765" xml_f="6772" txt_i="3731" txt_f="3738">Table 1</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="6792" xml_f="6894" txt_i="3738" txt_f="3840">Aggregate mortality results from 13 randomised trials of steroids in head injury published before 1997</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="6984" xml_f="6991" txt_i="3842" txt_f="3849">Steroid</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="7015" xml_f="7022" txt_i="3850" txt_f="3857">Control</offsets></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="7070" xml_f="7085" txt_i="3858" txt_f="3873">No. of patients</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="7109" xml_f="7114" txt_i="3874" txt_f="3879">1,061</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="7138" xml_f="7143" txt_i="3880" txt_f="3885">1,087</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="7176" xml_f="7188" txt_i="3886" txt_f="3898">No. who died</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="7212" xml_f="7215" txt_i="3899" txt_f="3902">396</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="7239" xml_f="7242" txt_i="3903" txt_f="3906">422</offsets></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="7284" xml_f="7289" txt_i="3908" txt_f="3913">(37%)</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="7313" xml_f="7318" txt_i="3914" txt_f="3919">(39%)</offsets></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><offsets xml_i="7364" xml_f="7589" txt_i="3920" txt_f="4145">Absolute benefit of steroids 2%, indicating 1 death prevented for every 50 patients treated: but these previous trial results are also statistically compatible with there being no real benefit at all (or even a small hazard).</offsets></p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="7642" xml_f="7674" txt_i="4147" txt_f="4179">Corticosteroids in spinal injury</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7685" xml_f="7990" txt_i="4180" txt_f="4485">Recent evidence of benefit from corticosteroids in acute spinal cord injury has renewed interest in their possible role in brain injury.
