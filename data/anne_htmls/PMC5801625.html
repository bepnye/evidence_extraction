Once developed, these could be difficult to treat. They often result in pain, disfigurement, prolonged hospitalization, and additional costs. In such patients, mortality is considerably high due to complications if these are not managed timely and effectively. Hence, prevention of bedsores is always better than treating the complications associated with it. Prevention is a key intervention that is neither novel nor expensive.

An analysis of knowledge, attitude, and perception of the caregivers regarding care of bedridden patients in the home care settings will help in devising strategies to improve the care of such patients.
