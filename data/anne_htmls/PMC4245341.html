When detected in early stages, most gynecologic cancers have a good cure rate. Gynecologic oncologists are concerned not only with provision of a disease-free state but also with preservation of an optimum quality of life after cancer treatment as development in treatment regimens and supportive care strategies. Ovarian preservation has become a major issue to gynecologic oncology in premenopausal patients, due to both the increasing age at childbearing and the increasing incidence of gynecologic cancer in young patients. These days, possibility of preservation of fertility primarily depends on the extent and type of cancer in young patients with gynecologic cancer.

It is hampered by several factors that estimation of risk of ovarian damage from chemotherapy for patients with different types of cancers. Historically ovarian function was assessed with nonobjective parameters such as menstrual history, which is not checkable in cases of hysterectomy, or vasomotor symptoms. Thus, more objective and reliable parameters are necessary, such as serum FSH levels, ovarian volume, antral follicle counts, and antimullerianhormone (AMH) assessment [</offsets><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="16880" xml_f="16882" txt_i="11188" txt_f="11190">25</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16889" xml_f="16890" txt_i="11190" txt_f="11191">,</offsets><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="16922" xml_f="16924" txt_i="11191" txt_f="11193">26</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16931" xml_f="16932" txt_i="11193" txt_f="11194">,</offsets><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="16964" xml_f="16966" txt_i="11194" txt_f="11196">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16973" xml_f="17221" txt_i="11196" txt_f="11444">].

We had observed patients from the last chemotherapy cycle during 3.6 years.

Because of the limited follow-up period, however, no prediction can be given on long-term fertility and subsequent development of POF in the future. Although the small size of study group, the heterogeneity of the treatment and absence of control group may be a limitation of this study, we have evaluated that the use of a GnRH-a during chemotherapy may have been effective for ovary protection in 14 premenopausal women with gynecologic cancer in short-term. Twelve of the fourteen patients continue to be under our clinical observation. If we continue our clinical observation with these patients, further understanding of long-term effect of GnRH-a to prevent premature menopause can be obtained. New patients are being enrolled for further study on chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure and retained consecutive observation. As the rate of young cancer survivors is increasing, fertility and ovarian function preservation for quality of life is becoming more relevant. Providing cancer patients with timely information related to the potential gonadotoxicity and options for fertility preservation is imperative.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
