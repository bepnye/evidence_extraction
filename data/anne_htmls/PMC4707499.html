First, the database was scrutinised to identify OCTs captured on a spectral domain system. Second, visits were identified for which the OCT grading data were consistent with a quiescent lesion. Finally, a senior grader from the NetwORC and a retinal specialist reviewed the proposed ‘baseline' sets of images; for each confirmed quiescent lesion, CFs and spectral domain OCTs for other visits for the same patient were inspected to identify another study visit for which eligible images were available.
