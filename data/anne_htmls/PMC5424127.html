Obstacles to smoking cessation include limited access and adherence to effective cessation interventions. Technology can help overcome these obstacles; many smartphone apps have been developed to aid smoking cessation, but few that conform to the US clinical practice guideline (USCPG) have been rigorously tested and reported in the literature. Clickotine is a novel smartphone app for smoking cessation, designed to deliver the essential features of the USCPG and engineered to engage smokers by personalizing intervention components.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title><offsets xml_i="7248" xml_f="7257" txt_i="720" txt_f="729">Objective</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7268" xml_f="7663" txt_i="730" txt_f="1125">Our objective was to assess the engagement, efficacy, and safety of Clickotine in an initial, single-arm study.

Among the 365 study completers, 51.5% (n=188) of participants reported achieving 7-day abstinence and 29.9% (n=109) of participants achieved 30-day abstinence. In this study, participants did not appear to reliably provide the in-app weekly smoking data. Only 47 of the 416 participants (11.3%) provided complete data in the weekly cigarette counts; across all users, only 822 of the 3328 (24.7%) weekly cigarette counts were completed. Thus, we derived smoking status from self-report in the baseline and outcome surveys, and we did not use the in-app smoking data in the analyses of cessation outcomes.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="49994" xml_f="50009" txt_i="30748" txt_f="30763">Safety Outcomes</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="50020" xml_f="50627" txt_i="30764" txt_f="31371">Participants reported 4 negative health events spontaneously, and reported an additional 32 in response to the focused safety question in the 8-week questionnaire.

For example, one cessation app study noted that iOS users demonstrated indicators of greater motivation to quit compared with Android users [</offsets><xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="72083" xml_f="72085" txt_i="41919" txt_f="41921">57</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="72092" xml_f="72342" txt_i="41921" txt_f="42171">]. Third, this trial relied on self-reported smoking cessation to estimate 30-day point prevalence abstinence. While expert consensus suggests that biochemical verification of abstinence is impractical and unnecessary in studies similar to this one [</offsets><xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="72376" xml_f="72378" txt_i="42171" txt_f="42173">58</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="72385" xml_f="73562" txt_i="42173" txt_f="43350">], future research will need to address this by implementing biochemical verification of smoking cessation (eg, exhaled carbon monoxide). Fourth, in a study of an intervention conducted by the developer of the intervention, the potential for biases (eg, rater biases, response biases) are noted. Despite efforts to eliminate the opportunity for such biases through the design and implementation of rigorous study procedures, the potential for bias will limit the extent to which our results can be interpreted beyond being preliminary indicators. Fifth, some users (29 at baseline and 66 by study outcome) were using a pharmacotherapy cessation aid during the trial, which could have contributed to the cessation rates observed and limits the ability to attribute cessation solely to Clickotine. To overcome such limitations, a pivotal study of Clickotine should evaluate efficacy and test superiority in a blinded, randomized controlled trial conducted by an independent party; include iPhone and Android versions of the app; include an active comparator arm with an alternative mobile app; feature longer-term follow-up; and ascertain abstinence via biochemical verification.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="73569" xml_f="74015" txt_i="43351" txt_f="43797">In summary, the results of this initial evaluation suggest that Clickotine participants engaged with the app and appeared to remain engaged with the app for a majority of the study duration on average, and that Clickotine use may be associated with cessation outcomes. Future research is warranted to evaluate the engagement with and efficacy of Clickotine in more robust clinical trials, and to assess Clickotine’s long-term efficacy and safety.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>All authors contributed equally to the conduct of the trial and the writing of the manuscript.
