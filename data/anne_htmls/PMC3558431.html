Obtaining health impact data for rural sanitation campaigns poses a number of methodological challenges. Here we describe the design of a village-level cluster-randomised trial in the state of Orissa, India to evaluate the impact of an ongoing rural sanitation campaign conducted under the umbrella of India’s Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC).We randomised 50 villages to the intervention and 50 villages to control. In the intervention villages the implementing non-governmental organisations conducted community mobilisation and latrine construction with subsidies given to poor families. Control villages receive no intervention. Outcome measures include (1) diarrhoea in children under 5 and in all ages, (2) soil-transmitted helminth infections, (3) anthropometric measures, (4) water quality, (5) number of insect vectors (flies, mosquitoes), (6) exposure to faecal pathogens in the environment. In addition we are conducting process documentation (latrine construction and use, intervention reach), cost and cost-effectiveness analyses, spatial analyses and qualitative research on gender and water use for sanitation.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6301" xml_f="6308" txt_i="1398" txt_f="1405">Results</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6319" xml_f="6768" txt_i="1406" txt_f="1855">Randomisation resulted in an acceptable balance between trial arms.

While we envisioned requiring that each eligible village have its own primary school, that requirement was dropped prior to village selection in order to meet the sample size. 28 out of 100 villages did not have a primary school at the time of enrolment. Households within villages were eligible if there was a child under 4 years (verified with immunization card), or a pregnant woman. Informed written consent was obtained from the male and/or female head of the household. We administered a questionnaire to each female head of enrolled household (demographics, socio-economic characteristics, water, hygiene and sanitation). Study villages were then randomly allocated to intervention and control stratified by block ensuring overall equal numbers of clusters in both arms. We follow an open cohort design. Households with a new baby born during the surveillance phase are also enrolled. Randomisation achieved a fair balance of socio-economic and water/sanitation related characteristics (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><offsets xml_i="17846" xml_f="17847" txt_i="11162"

While much of the focus in rural sanitation is on increasing coverage in order to report progress on the MDG target, interventions will not reduce exposure or prevent disease unless they are adopted by the target population. As an evaluation of a sanitation intervention as actually delivered by a leading NGO working in accordance with a large-scale government programme, the study is designed to have a high level of external validity. However, the study is limited by the circumstances in which it is located and the manner in which the intervention is executed. Coordinating community mobilisation and construction of latrines as implemented by different local NGOs in 50 randomly selected villages proved a challenge, with coverage increasing at a lower rate than expected. In the intervention arm, we expect latrine coverage of about 60% during much of the follow up period. The community mobilisation was implemented by the different NGOs with varying intensity and success. However, based on previous reports from different states in India, it seems unlikely that TSC as implemented in the trial population differs greatly from what normally is achieved [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="45858" xml_f="45860" txt_i="31147" txt_f="31149">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45867" xml_f="45868" txt_i="31149" txt_f="31150">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20"><offsets xml_i="45900" xml_f="45902" txt_i="31150" txt_f="31152">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="45909" xml_f="45911" txt_i="31152" txt_f="31154">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="45918" xml_f="46708" txt_i="31155" txt_f="31945">Roll-out over one or more years may appear as a long time for the purposes of an RCT, but is a short time for achieving sustained behaviour change and latrine use. Evaluating the true impact of sanitation at a point in time when use of latrines becomes socially accepted, or even a socially desirable behaviour in the target population may be beyond the scope of RCTs as a tool for health impact evaluation. Withholding sanitation from randomly allocated control villages for more than two years may be ethically and politically unfeasible. The implementation of the intervention in the control villages means losing them for direct between-arm comparison. In this situation, some causal inference may be achieved by interpreting the disease trends in both arms following the intervention [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45"><offsets xml_i="46740" xml_f="46742" txt_i="31945" txt_f="31947">45</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46749" xml_f="46750" txt_i="31947" txt_f="31948">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46"><offsets xml_i="46782" xml_f="46784" txt_i="31948" txt_f="31950">46</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46791" xml_f="47280" txt_i="31950" txt_f="32439">], but the strength of the evidence will be weaker.

Throughout the trial we aim at minimising the extent to which the study population would be exposed to the trial procedures. Because the teams in charge for the different activities and outcomes are visiting the villages separately, most villagers do not make a direct link between the health outcome measurement and the latrine construction. This is aided by the fact that many NGOs are working in the area for different purposes. This risk of bias will be evaluated through qualitative and quantitative data towards the end of the study, including comparisons of subjective health outcomes (reported diarrhoea) with objective health outcomes (anthropometrics, helminth infection), with other non-health outcomes (school attendance) and with intermediate environmental outcomes that assess the impact of the intervention on exposure. Analysis of associations between self-reported outcomes and intervention coverage and uptake may also be helpful in exploring bias.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="48579" xml_f="49476" txt_i="33687" txt_f="34584">Four considerations may be especially important in designing evaluations of sanitation interventions in order to deal with the complexity of the subject. First, process evaluation - documenting the manner in which the intervention is actually implemented rather than intended or reported by the program implementers - is essential to put health outcomes into perspective. Similarly, measuring latrine use (compliance) is critical since lack of use even by a minority of the population may compromise the potential health impact. Third, because even effective sanitation may be insufficient in preventing diarrhoeal disease and helminth infection, it is necessary to assess whether the intervention has reduced exposure to pathogens, especially if no health impact is found. In our study we attempt to achieve this by looking at the main transmission pathways suggested by the so-called F-Diagram [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34"><offsets xml_i="49508" xml_f="49510" txt_i="34584" txt_f="34586">34</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="49517" xml_f="49954" txt_i="34586" txt_f="35023">], such as fluids (water), fields (food and surrounding environment), flies (mechanical vectors) and fingers (hand hygiene). Fourth, unlike handwashing with soap or household water treatment where a household might protect itself by high compliance, sanitation may require compliance by one’s neighbours as well.

However, the policy implications of the trial results (expected in late 2013) may need to be considered with similar caution.
