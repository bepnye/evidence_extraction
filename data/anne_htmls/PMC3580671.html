For patients with multiple organisms at the same infection site, microbiologic evaluation was based on organisms susceptible to meropenem. Detection of a new pathogen from the site of infection during the meropenem therapy was evaluated as colonization if no new antibiotic therapy was indicated, or as superinfection if antibiotic therapy to target the results of the new culture was established. Patients who developed colonization were classified as microbiological successes; patients with superinfection caused by pathogens involved in therapeutic spectrum of meropenem were assessed as microbiological failures.

Continuous normally distributed data were tested with paired or unpaired t test, not normally distributed data using Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

Some factors could contribute to these negative results. First, our sample size calculation was based on previously published results (Grant 2002, Lorente 2007), but these seem to be overly optimistic. Second, more than half of evaluated groups comprised post-surgery or trauma patients and other factors could play a role in their outcome. Nevertheless, the major cause of the failure to prove better clinical outcome in the Infusion group consists probably in the disproportion of daily cumulative dose of meropenem between groups (four grams in the Infusion and six grams in the Bolus group) and little difference between both types of meropenem administration in achieving T &gt; MIC in relatively susceptible pathogens.

This could explain the discrepancy between insignificant clinical and positive bacteriological results, especially in view of the fact that a microbiologist blinded to the patients' allocation group performed microbiological assessment. Another limitation is frequent concomitant antibiotic therapy (48.1% in the Infusion and 50.9% in the Bolus group) reducing the validity of conclusions about the only impact of meropenem.

Using this dose, the concentration of meropenem could reach T &gt; MIC for 100% of dosing interval in the susceptible pathogens with relatively low MIC.

We did not monitor time between the onset of sepsis and administration of antibiotic therapy, which is an important variable correlating with the outcome. Nevertheless, the patients of both groups were treated by the stable team in one ICU, so we could presume that there were no substantial differences between both groups in periods between the onset of sepsis and the start of therapy.
