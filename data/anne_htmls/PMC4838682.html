Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is recommended in UK clinical guidelines for the management of depression in people with long-term conditions. Access to skilled therapists competent in managing the competing mental and physical health demands of ESKD is limited. Online CBT treatments tailored to the needs of the ESKD population offers a pragmatic solution for under-resourced services.

Outcomes include feasibility and acceptability descriptive data on rates of recruitment, randomisation, retention and treatment adherence.

In brief, our CBT formulation recognises the unique acute and chronic stressors that occur in the dialysis population including: ESKD diagnosis, surgical procedures needed for vascular access site generation, loss of independence, changes in body and self-image, uncertainty about health and future, the unseen burden of kidney disease, and chronic illness self-management challenges, specifically managing thirst and food cravings, and dealing with health professionals. CBT intervention techniques for managing these illness-specific stressors are then introduced in subsequent online treatment sessions.

Likewise, the study will be able to simultaneously examine the acceptability of this treatment to patients in terms of whether its content was relevant and useful. In addition, the utility of the online mode of delivery with or without telephone support will be examined. We anticipate that the results of this trial will substantially inform the design of a future large-scale trial powered to detect the efficacy of online CBT treatments for the management of distress in dialysis.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s12"><title><offsets xml_i="52794" xml_f="52806" txt_i="39633" txt_f="39645">Trial status</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="52817" xml_f="53044" txt_i="39646" txt_f="39873">The study started recruitment in February 2015.
