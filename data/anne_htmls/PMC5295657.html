Dyslipidemia is a high level of lipids (cholesterol, triglycerides [TGs], or both) carried by lipoproteins in the blood. This term includes hyperlipoproteinemia (hyperlipidemia), which refers to abnormally high levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) or TG, as well as an abnormally low level of high density lipoprotein (HDL-C). Hyperlipidemia can have a serious effect on health (</offsets><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="7196" xml_f="7197" txt_i="2623" txt_f="2624">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7204" xml_f="7440" txt_i="2624" txt_f="2860">).

The control group was asked to have lovastatin (40 mg/day) along with 150 cc low-fat yogurt at the lunch time. Two weeks and also 1 month after starting the study, all the patients underwent biochemical tests including cholesterol, TG, LDL-C, HDL-C, VLDL and fasting blood sugar (FBS) at the same laboratory (by BT3000 auto-analyzer) and the results were registered in separate files related to each patient.

The results of study showed that cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C and TG had a significant reduction during the study. However, this rate of reduction was not statistically significant in control and intervention group. The difference HDL-C rate was significant before and after study in the two groups; this difference increased in the intervention group with the average rate of 5.5 units and decreased in control group with the average rate of 2.5 units. The mean of LDL/HDL ratio decreased during the study. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups. The mean of FBS had no change during the study and both groups were similar in this respect.

Also caffeic acid in this plant has antioxidant properties which can decrease harmful lipids through inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. The cholesterol synthesis regulation is normally done by HMG-CoA. The conversion reaction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate takes place by the mediation of HMG-CoA reductase and NADPH (Nicotine amide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) that is the main affecting point of statins antihypercholesterolemic agents (</offsets><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="18778" xml_f="18780" txt_i="10601" txt_f="10603">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18787" xml_f="19152" txt_i="10603" txt_f="10968">). One explanation for our result is taking lovastatin as treatment in both intervention and control groups. Since researchers could not deprive patients from taking drug in the human study due to ethical issues. Taking lovastatin will lead the level of lipid to a normal level. This issue causes that the consumption of the plant cannot decrease the lipid easily.
