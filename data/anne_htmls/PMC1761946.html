One of the observations characterized as problematic in these studies is that participants often make relatively few website visits and spend only a brief time accessing the program. Properly structured websites permit the unobtrusive measurement of the ways in which participants access (are exposed to) program content. Research on participant exposure to Web-based programs is not merely of interest to technologists, but represents an important opportunity to better understand the broader theme of program engagement and to guide the development of more effective interventions.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="objectives"><title><offsets xml_i="4855" xml_f="4865" txt_i="695" txt_f="705">Objectives</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4876" xml_f="5113" txt_i="706" txt_f="943">The current paper seeks to provide working definitions and describe initial patterns of various measures of participant exposure to ChewFree.com, a large randomized controlled trial of a Web-based program for smokeless tobacco cessation.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="5154" xml_f="5161" txt_i="945" txt_f="952">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="5172" xml_f="5584" txt_i="953" txt_f="1365">We examined measures of participant exposure to either an Enhanced condition Web-based program (interactive, tailored, and rich-media program) or a Basic condition control website (static, text-based material).

If, following the end of the assessment, a participant continued to explore the Web-based content, then that event was counted as a unique visit and assigned a value of zero (since zero days had elapsed since the end of the baseline assessment).

Since all participants stopped using their assigned website in the analysis period (the defined terminal event), no cases were censored.

For example, we were able to measure the extent to which participants in either condition accessed a ChewFree.com Web page that provided links to other websites offering smokeless tobacco cessation information and assistance (eg, the National Cancer Institute, the National Spit Tobacco Education Program, and the Oral Health America Foundation).</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="23895" xml_f="24580" txt_i="16633" txt_f="17318">In the Enhanced condition, we also measured participants' use of ChewFree.com Web pages that offered more interactive features, including whether they viewed pages that automatically played video testimonials, whether they accessed a Web page that offered a print feature (and triggered a print dialog box), and whether they listed the names of people whom they believed could offer useful support for smokeless tobacco cessation.

A total of 40.7% of participants (488/1220) who reported having quit using smokeless tobacco during the course of the program were eligible to be sent a series of emails supportive of continued abstinence. However, the number of participants who were sent these supportive emails was reduced to 34.8% (425/1220) because 63 had opted out of receiving program-generated emails.

The use of intensive treatment approaches and preliminary litmus tests of commitment must be tempered by recognizing the continuum between clinic-based and public-health models for intervention. Specifically, it may be not be a practical goal to provide a highly intensive, population-wide intervention. Moreover, the use of preliminary barriers may help to reduce attrition in efficacy trials but reduce our ability to conduct effectiveness trials that have a broader reach and greater potential to achieve public health impact [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46"><offsets xml_i="42790" xml_f="42792" txt_i="29484" txt_f="29486">46</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42799" xml_f="42800" txt_i="29486" txt_f="29487">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47"><offsets xml_i="42834" xml_f="42836" txt_i="29487" txt_f="29489">47</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="42843" xml_f="43143" txt_i="29489" txt_f="29789">].

We anticipate that some measures of exposure and outcome will likely share a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship such that those individuals who are least ready to make a meaningful change may be more likely to visit the Web-based program for a short time, while participants who are most prepared to change their behavior may similarly choose to visit the Web-based program for a relatively short time. Those participants who are interested in quitting and decide to learn more about how to do so will spend relatively more time visiting the program. It remains for future research to differentiate characteristics that illuminate the pattern of this relationship among motivation, readiness to quit, and program usage.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44102" xml_f="44909" txt_i="30736" txt_f="31543">Measures of participant exposure can help researchers and program developers determine the extent to which content is viewed. These data can point to needed changes in the information architecture and design features of the website. It is reasonable to assume that program content cannot be helpful if it is never viewed. Exposure measures may have utility in that they inform us about whether certain content—or clusters of content—is related to outcome and thus might be considered to be active ingredients in accomplishing the desired behavioral goals. They enable us to better understand idiosyncratic patterns of program use, highlighting ways we can adapt program structure and content to better accommodate (be tailored to) individual differences in participant interests, needs, and learning styles.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="44916" xml_f="46015" txt_i="31544" txt_f="32643">In this regard, we intend to examine a variety of relationships between and among measures of exposure and the smokeless tobacco and tobacco cessation outcome measures in the ChewFree.com research project. For example, we will test whether participants who set a quit date are more successful in quitting, as well as whether, after quitting, there is a relationship between accessing content from the Staying Quit module (number and duration of visits) and lasting abstinence. Similarly, we will examine whether those participants who spend more time reviewing program content after they have lapsed are better able to regain control over their behavior and regain abstinence. We also plan to perform content and text analyses of Web forum postings [eg, 48] to explore whether smokeless tobacco cessation might be related to message types, whether cessation and maintenance strategies shared in postings are consistent with program recommendations, and the extent to which postings convey differing levels of confidence and self-efficacy across participants as well as within participants over time.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46022" xml_f="46496" txt_i="32644" txt_f="33118">There is a significant risk of collecting so much detailed exposure and engagement data that the task of analyzing and interpreting results becomes difficult.
