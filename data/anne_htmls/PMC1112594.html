Reasons for not having high expectations included the experimental nature of their care and possibility that they may get a placebo. Participants were hopeful because their pain was so severe and because they trusted the staff and services. Most (83%) wanted to be informed about their treatment allocation and study results.

Klopfer describes how within ten days: 'all signs of his disease [had] vanished'. The patient relapsed within two months when he learned that trials results were inconclusive. His clinician somehow managed to convince the patient that he had: 'a new super refined, double strength product', but instead administered saline injections. The patients' response to these injections was described as: 'even more dramatic than the first'. He remained symptom free for over two months, until he read that: "nationwide tests show Krebiozen to be a worthless drug in treatment of cancer".

Although many trial participants could not remember the names of the treatments being investigated, most were able to distinguish between a pharmacologically active and a non-specific treatment which they described in their own words as placebo (e.g. 'the one with nothing in it') or the wrong treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36437" xml_f="36876" txt_i="26799" txt_f="27238">The trial is the largest RCT examining the effectiveness of corticosteroid for heel pain to date. Despite this, the trial population we were able to follow up was relatively small. Furthermore, 43% of the participants interviewed reported that their heel pain was recurrent and for almost 20% it was continuous. The cyclical nature of heel pain further limits our ability to extrapolate on the relationship between cognitions and outcomes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36883" xml_f="37148" txt_i="27239" txt_f="27504">Reactions to debriefing were recorded immediately after the information was communicated.

It is important to try and avoid creating feelings of embarrassment, mistrust, or disillusionment and to prevent damaging a healing response. For this reason the distinction between 'placebo' and 'placebo effect' should to be made at informed consent, so that participants being enrolled in placebo-controlled trials do not focus on the possibility of receiving a 'dummy' or 'sham' pill, but are informed about the effect that derives from feelings and beliefs, the characteristics of the setting, and the effects of health care interactions [28]. Highlighting this distinction at the informed consent stage should help with debriefing at trial closure.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="38703" xml_f="38713" txt_i="28964" txt_f="28974">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38724" xml_f="39171" txt_i="28975" txt_f="29422">Our findings emphasize the importance of involving trial participants at study closure, by sharing study results and individual treatment allocation, while respecting individuals who do not wish to be debriefed.
