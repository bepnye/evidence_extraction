One possible mechanism for a beneficial effect on birth weight would be through increased maternal haemoglobin level, and an effect of anthelminthics on perinatal mortality might be mediated by improved birth weight. It is possible that women in those other studies cited who missed one or both doses of albendazole may also have missed their haematinics doses.

However mild to moderate anaemia may not significantly impact negatively on the perinatal outcomes. The same may not, however, apply to women who are not on routine iron and folic acid supplement during pregnancy as severe anaemia may worsen life-threatening obstetric complications and infant health. There is need to consider 2nd-trimester presumptive treatment for inclusion in our routine antenatal care practice.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>We wish to acknowledge the contribution of nursing staff of antenatal clinic, labour ward and postnatal ward and staff of the haematology department of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital towards the successful completion of the research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This research did not receive any financial support</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Competing Interests:</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Crompton</surname><given-names>DWT</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Public Health importance of Hookworm disease</article-title><source>Parasitol</source><year>2000</year><volume>121</volume><fpage>S39</fpage><lpage>S50</lpage><comment>https://doi.org/10.1017/S0031182000006454</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><source>Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis and Soil-transmitted Helminthiasis.
