Postoperatively, different techniques have been applied for pain relief such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-muscular and intravenous opioids, intrathecal and epidural narcotics, and patient-controlled analgesia, most of which are associated with side effects (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4815R1"><offsets xml_i="6174" xml_f="6175" txt_i="2121" txt_f="2122">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6182" xml_f="6184" txt_i="2122" txt_f="2124">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4815R2"><offsets xml_i="6220" xml_f="6221" txt_i="2124" txt_f="2125">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6228" xml_f="6416" txt_i="2125" txt_f="2313">). Intra-articular local anesthetics such as bupivacaine provide post-operative analgesia of immediate onset, but short duration, following which patients require supplementary analgesia (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4815R3"><offsets xml_i="6452" xml_f="6453" txt_i="2313" txt_f="2314">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6460" xml_f="6885" txt_i="2314" txt_f="2739">). Nevertheless, the intra-articular administration of narcotic-like local analgesics has received further attention during the past decades. Opiates such as morphine and tramadol have peripheral and central analgesic effects, and there is evidence that there are opiate receptors at the terminals of afferent peripheral nerves, therefore, administration of opiates peripherally might provide a significant analgesic effect (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4815R4"><offsets xml_i="6921" xml_f="6922" txt_i="2739" txt_f="2740">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6929" xml_f="6931" txt_i="2740" txt_f="2742">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4815R5"><offsets xml_i="6967" xml_f="6968" txt_i="2742" txt_f="2743">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6975" xml_f="7073" txt_i="2743" txt_f="2841">).

We included patients who had undergone; partial meniscectomy, chondroplasty, removal of loose bodies and diagnostic arthroscopy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 5 mg morphine or 50 mg tramadol intra-articularly. All solutions were injected at the end of the operation and before tourniquet release, with the tourniquet being released 10 minutes after the injection was administrated. Preoperatively, patients were instructed to report their pain with a verbal pain rating score (VRS) at rest and on movement of the knee joint. Postoperative pain was also assessed by VRS at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours. VRS is a 10-point scale tool for evaluation of pain intensity; “0” represents “no pain,” while “10” is the “worst imaginable pain”. Furthermore, the patients were monitored post-operatively for a period of 24 hours for the following parameters; pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, level of analgesia, time of first analgesic request (usually associated with VRS &gt; 3) and need for supplemental analgesic. Supplemental analgesia was provided with diclofenac sodium oral tablets and total consumption was recorded over 24 hours. Meanwhile, the following exclusion criteria were applied at baseline; evidence of any major systemic illness, major knee surgery, history of allergy to any of the drugs in the study, morphine addiction, regional anesthesia or history of convulsive disorders.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9191" xml_f="9623" txt_i="4823" txt_f="5255">The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of university and all patients were requested to give their informed consent.

In the present study, we have sought to evaluate the efficacy of intra-articularly administered morphine and tramadol on postoperative pain following minor arthroscopic knee surgery. Our results revealed improvements in postoperative pain relief, with both local analgesics. Stein et al. showed that low doses of intra-articular morphine, injected on the completion of arthroscopic knee surgery can produce post-operative analgesia via the activation of local opioid receptors in the knee joint (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4815R8"><offsets xml_i="18632" xml_f="18633" txt_i="9380" txt_f="9381">8</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18640" xml_f="18762" txt_i="9381" txt_f="9503">). Several other studies have shown similar findings, however, Heard found no benefit with morphine compared to controls (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4815R9"><offsets xml_i="18798" xml_f="18799" txt_i="9503" txt_f="9504">9</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="18806" xml_f="19104" txt_i="9504" txt_f="9802">). Other studies have proposed different intra-articular solutions as post-operative pain relievers. Injection of bupivacaine following arthroscopy has been demonstrated to be both safe and effective in providing post-operative analgesia, although the mean duration of analgesia is only two hours (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4815R10"><offsets xml_i="19141" xml_f="19143" txt_i="9802" txt_f="9804">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19150" xml_f="19341" txt_i="9804" txt_f="9995">). Moreover, intra-articular clonidine has been reported to provide post-operative analgesia for up to 533 minutes in patients undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery under regional anesthesia (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4815R11"><offsets xml_i="19378" xml_f="19380" txt_i="9995" txt_f="9997">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19387" xml_f="20917" txt_i="9997" txt_f="11527">), unfortunately, both of these drugs are associated with systemic side effects. In our study, morphine-treated patients reported postoperative pain on average 1.5 hours following their operation and requested supplemental analgesics on average 2.2 hours postoperatively. In contrast, tramadol-treated subjects reported pain at 1.2 hours and requested supplemental analgesics 2.7 hours postoperatively. Hence, tramadol is associated with shorter, but relatively more satisfactory pain-relief in comparison with morphine. Nonetheless, a shorter duration of operation (1.8 vs. 2.1 hours), lower preoperative VRS scores (4.6 and 5.9 vs. 5.0 and 6.1 at rest and on movement of knee joint, respectively), and smaller sample size (57 vs. 75 subjects) could misinterpret this conclusion. Furthermore, post-operative VRS scores at 6, 12, and 24 hours were significantly decreased when compared with previous scores in both morphine and tramadol prescribed subjects. Therefore, we can conclude that both local analgesics reach a maximum effect six hours post-injection and their effect lasts for at least 18 hours. In contrast, in a study by Iqbala et al., six patients in the control group received rescue analgesic in the first postoperative hour compared to none in the morphine group. They concluded that the onset of intra-articular morphine action is immediate and intra-articular morphine provided significant post-operative analgesia for three hours with the highest rescue analgesic requirement in the fourth post-operative hour (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A4815R1"><offsets xml_i="20953" xml_f="20954" txt_i="11527" txt_f="11528">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20961" xml_f="21284" txt_i="11528" txt_f="11851">). Disparities between the different studies could be explained in part by the varied doses of local anesthesia used in the intra-articular instillation. Of more importance may be the VRS system of pain scoring that is patient-dependent and is relatively lacking in sensitivity, especially when pain is absent or even mild.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="21291" xml_f="21712" txt_i="11852" txt_f="12273">Our study had some limitations. Lack of a control group receiving a placebo is the major drawback. Like other studies of the same protocol, VRS is an insensitive scoring system. In conclusion, based on the data presented in this study, we have found a postoperative analgesic effect of intra-articularly administered local anesthesia following minor arthroscopic knee surgery with a maximum effect 6 hours post injection.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank all patients and staff of Akhtar Hospital for their kindly cooperation.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="afn277" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Funding/Support:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn id="afn280" fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Financial Disclosure:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn id="afn4526" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:</bold> Intra-articular analgesia is a frequent pain reliever after arthroscopic knee surgeries.
