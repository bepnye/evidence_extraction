Patients in the intervention condition (n=124) were provided an account to access a Web-based information and decision tool aimed to support patients in acquiring an overview of their needs and appropriate treatment options provided by their mental health care organization. Patients were given the opportunity to use the Web-based tool either on their own (at their home computer or at a computer of the service) or with the support of an assistant. Patients in the control group received care as usual (n=126). Half of the patients in the sample were patients experiencing a first episode of psychosis; the other half were patients with a chronic psychosis. Primary outcome was patient-perceived involvement in medical decision making, measured with the Combined Outcome Measure for Risk Communication and Treatment Decision-making Effectiveness (COMRADE).

The first webpage presents a questionnaire about care needs based on items of the CANSAS-P (see </offsets><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1"><offsets xml_i="18989" xml_f="18997" txt_i="11518" txt_f="11526">Figure 1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19004" xml_f="19172" txt_i="11526" txt_f="11694">).

Furthermore, an assistant was available by phone for help on 3 days each week. Patients received a log-in account by email or on paper from an assistant.

Participating clinicians were asked to complete an attitude questionnaire around the same time. Up to 6 weeks after the ROM session, patients in the intervention condition had the opportunity to make use of the Web-based tool. Approximately 6 weeks after ROM, a meeting was planned between the patient and a key clinician in which ROM results were evaluated and a new treatment plan was created or an existing one was adjusted. Patients were sent a final questionnaire by mail. Upon returning the questionnaire to our research center, they received a gift certificate worth €7.50. We deviated from the procedure described in the original research protocol in 1 important aspect: we conducted 1 follow-up measurement instead of 2 because a second follow-up meeting appeared to be not feasible within the time limits.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23246" xml_f="23254" txt_i="15168" txt_f="15176">Measures</offsets></title><sec><title><offsets xml_i="23274" xml_f="23282" txt_i="15177" txt_f="15185">Baseline</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="23293" xml_f="23401" txt_i="15186" txt_f="15294">Self-reported quality of life was measured with the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16"><offsets xml_i="23435" xml_f="23437" txt_i="15294" txt_f="15296">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="23444" xml_f="23654" txt_i="15296" txt_f="15506">].

This might have affected patients’ expectations of the intervention.

This evaluation showed that no significant problems could be observed in the attitude and beliefs of clinicians. Participating clinicians had an overall positive attitude toward shared decision making. They reported that their patients were generally interested in and capable of participating in medical decision making, they considered patient decision aids be to potentially helpful, and they judged relatively few factors to be hampering in a shared decision-making process. However, problems were observed in the implementation of the intervention. Not all patients in the intervention group were actually offered the possibility to use the decision aid and, more importantly, ROM and treatment evaluation meetings in which the treatment plan was to be discussed in a process of shared decision making did not always take place. Moreover, interviews indicate that the Web-based intervention might have been framed differently to different patients, which may have shaped their expectations and affected their evaluation. An interesting finding in the process evaluation was that patients who perceived their involvement in medical decision making as low were judged by clinicians to be less capable of participating in decision making. This could imply that patients participate less because they are less capable. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that patients participate less because clinicians consider them less capable and, therefore, provide less opportunities for patients to participate in decision making.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="51410" xml_f="52399" txt_i="34583" txt_f="35572">The findings of our trial show that more than one-third of the patients who were provided access to the Web-based decision aid chose to use it and most used full functionality of the decision aid whether they were first-episode patients or long-term patients. Users and nonusers did not differ in demographic variables. At least one-quarter of the patients used their own computer and a similar proportion used the decision aid without assistance. Most of these were first-episode patients. On average, users of the decision aid reported to be rather satisfied with the system. Nevertheless, primary outcome results could not support the assumption that the use of electronic decision aids increases patient involvement in medical decision making, neither in intention-to-treat analyses nor in per protocol analyses.

This discrepancy can be explained by several reasons. First, the decision aids used in these trials differed in format (Hamann et al [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3"><offsets xml_i="53040" xml_f="53041" txt_i="36052" txt_f="36053">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="53048" xml_f="53384" txt_i="36053" txt_f="36389">] used a printed decision aid) and content. Some decision aids primarily concentrated on pharmacological information, whereas others had a broader focus. Second, settings were different. In our study, patients could use the decision aid either in the clinic or at home, with or without assistance, whereas in the trial by Hamann et al [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3"><offsets xml_i="53417" xml_f="53418" txt_i="36389" txt_f="36390">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="53425" xml_f="53562" txt_i="36390" txt_f="36527">], patients used the decision aid in a psychiatric ward with assistance of trained nurses.

Third, our response rate was very low. This is partly because of the naturalistic setting of our study. However, response rates are highly dependent on selection criteria used in studies. For example, if Steinwachs et al [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13"><offsets xml_i="53882" xml_f="53884" txt_i="36772" txt_f="36774">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="53891" xml_f="54588" txt_i="36774" txt_f="37471">] included all eligible patients (eg, not excluding patients who were considered unsuitable by their clinician), their response rate would have been comparable. Fourth, the outcome measures used in our study might have been too unspecific, indirect, or insensitive to detect differences in a small sample. The COMRADE measures patients’ perceived involvement in medical decision making with a self-report questionnaire that is completed retrospectively. What actually happens during the conversation between patient and clinician remains a black box. Furthermore, research has shown that ratings on patient satisfaction questionnaires tend to be more optimistic than patients’ actual evaluations [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28"><offsets xml_i="54622" xml_f="54624" txt_i="37471" txt_f="37473">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="54631" xml_f="54632" txt_i="37473" txt_f="37474">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29"><offsets xml_i="54666" xml_f="54668" txt_i="37474" txt_f="37476">29</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="54675" xml_f="55090" txt_i="37476" txt_f="37891">], implying that there may be less differentiation in the response behavior. Finally, discrepancies could, but are not likely to, be explained by lack of need for shared decision making in our patient sample. Patients’ mean score on the API, which indicates their preference for participation in medical decision making, was comparable to or even slightly higher than previous studies in people with schizophrenia [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2"><offsets xml_i="55123" xml_f="55124" txt_i="37891" txt_f="37892">2</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="55131" xml_f="55132" txt_i="37892" txt_f="37893">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3"><offsets xml_i="55165" xml_f="55166" txt_i="37893" txt_f="37894">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="55173" xml_f="55174" txt_i="37894" txt_f="37895">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30"><offsets xml_i="55208" xml_f="55210" txt_i="37895" txt_f="37897">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="55217" xml_f="55219" txt_i="37897" txt_f="37899">].</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="55241" xml_f="55266" txt_i="37901" txt_f="37926">Strengths and Limitations</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="55277" xml_f="56755" txt_i="37927" txt_f="39405">Given the problems observed in the process evaluation, the intervention designed for our study appeared not to fit in optimally with the routine practice of the participating clinical care teams. Therefore, the lack of significant effects on our outcome measures cannot be solely attributed to failures intrinsic to the intervention. Future studies might benefit from a stronger integration of shared decision-making interventions in clinical practice by training clinical teams in using (output) from decision aids. A comprehensive overview of the working flow of patients and clinicians is crucial to realize this integration. Given the low response rate and moderate participation rate in this study, it may also be desirable to investigate efficacy of decision aids in a less naturalistic setting in which participating patients are selected more strictly and required to use the decision aid before performing a naturalistic study. In addition, special attention should be paid to the selection of outcome measures used to assess the shared decision-making process. Instruments focusing on satisfaction might suffer from ceiling effects, and instruments such as the COMRADE may be too broad and indirect to detect changes in the decision-making process. A better alternative is to record conversations between clinicians and patients and observe what is actually happening within that conversation. A promising instrument for this may be the recently developed Mappin’SDM [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31"><offsets xml_i="56789" xml_f="56791" txt_i="39405" txt_f="39407">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="56798" xml_f="57116" txt_i="39407" txt_f="39725">], which combines patient, clinician, and observer perspectives. It is also important to note that using Web-based decision aids or support systems does not need to be a desirable target for all patients. Although some may benefit from new tools, others might not.

We tried to prevent this by preparing the participating teams before the start of the trial and keeping closely in touch during the trial (eg, being present at clinical meetings, functioning as helpdesk, sending individual emails to participating clinicians as reminders of specific actions). Another important limitation is the large numbers of dropouts before the follow-up measurement, even though patients were offered a small gift for returning their completed questionnaire.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="57776" xml_f="58574" txt_i="40373" txt_f="41171">Our study also has strengths.

Our results suggest that part of the population is not able or does not feel the need to work with these decision aids. Based on our results, the ratio of users versus nonusers could be 50-50.
