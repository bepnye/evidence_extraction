According to data released by the World Health Organization, the incidence of skin cancer increased from 6.7 million in 1985 to 9 million in 1995 and to 10.5 million in 2000.

Previous studies have identified several factors in relation to the adoption of protective behaviors. Sensitive skin to the sun is a factor that makes the skin more easily damaged, and people with this type of skin are more likely to use sun protective equipment (</offsets><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8754" xml_f="8756" txt_i="2835" txt_f="2837">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8763" xml_f="8764" txt_i="2837" txt_f="2838">,</offsets><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="8796" xml_f="8798" txt_i="2838" txt_f="2840">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="8805" xml_f="9069" txt_i="2840" txt_f="3104">).

One of the most important efforts to control and prevent diseases is educating groups of people at risk (</offsets><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9542" xml_f="9544" txt_i="3422" txt_f="3424">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9551" xml_f="9720" txt_i="3424" txt_f="3593">). The impact of education depends on the appropriate use of scientific behavioral theories; there are several models in the literature to describe the health behavior (</offsets><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9752" xml_f="9754" txt_i="3593" txt_f="3595">17</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="9761" xml_f="9961" txt_i="3595" txt_f="3795">). One of the theories used widely is Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). This theory was introduced by Rogers in 1975, then used largely as a framework for interventions related to health behaviors (</offsets><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="9993" xml_f="9995" txt_i="3795" txt_f="3797">18</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10002" xml_f="10003" txt_i="3797" txt_f="3798">,</offsets><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10035" xml_f="10037" txt_i="3798" txt_f="3800">19</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10044" xml_f="10221" txt_i="3800" txt_f="3977">).

Threat appraisal focuses on maladaptive behaviors and factors that increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors; also it includes internal and external rewards for unhealthy behaviors and perceived threats (perceived susceptibility and severity). Received rewards from abusive practices will increase the probability of maladaptive behaviors while perceived threat can reduce maladaptive behaviors (</offsets><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10706" xml_f="10708" txt_i="4391" txt_f="4393">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10715" xml_f="10716" txt_i="4393" txt_f="4394">,</offsets><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="10748" xml_f="10750" txt_i="4394" txt_f="4396">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="10757" xml_f="10760" txt_i="4396" txt_f="4399">).

The SPSS statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for analysis of the data. For assessment of the data homogeneity at baseline, the Chi-square test was used for demographic variables, and PMT variables of the two groups were analyzed through independent samples t-test. The normality of the data was also assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Differences between the data before and 3 months after the intervention in both groups was determined using independent t-test, paired t-test, and chi-square.
