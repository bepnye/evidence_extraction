However, we had to increase the number of patients to be screened to reach this number. This was done because the percentage of patients eligible for the MINI interview was lower than in the pilot study. Furthermore, the percentage of patients refusing the MINI interview was higher than expected. To arrive at a gross number of 360 patients we had to screen a total number of 8326 patients. The response rate to the screening questionnaire was 67%. Eventually, 361 non-severely depressed patients were recruited in the study (DM: N = 184; COPD: N = 177). All interventions have been administered; currently follow-up data are being collected.
