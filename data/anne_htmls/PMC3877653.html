Telbivudine treatment reduces risks of end-stage disease manifestations such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its use has been limited due to the development of resistance mutations in the HBV polymerase-reverse transcriptase. It was reported that 5.0% and 2.3% of HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients developed resistance to the drug at week 52, and at week 104 the resistance rates were 17.8% and 7.3% (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A15573R21"><offsets xml_i="28487" xml_f="28489" txt_i="13371" txt_f="13373">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="28496" xml_f="28498" txt_i="13373" txt_f="13375">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A15573R22"><offsets xml_i="28536" xml_f="28538" txt_i="13375" txt_f="13377">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="28545" xml_f="29344" txt_i="13377" txt_f="14173">). Telbivudine-resistance is rather a big problem: additional drugs such as adefovir are required to suppress the virus, and the patients would have to bear an increased economic burden and higher risk of developing end-stage disease. If we predict the effect of telbivudine before administration, many medical resources would be saved, and many subsequent problems would be avoided. Therefore, we conducted this study. In this study, a model using serum concentrations of bilirubin and ALT, plasma HBV DNA level, and family history of HBV infection, accurately predicted the early virological response (R &gt; -0.38). The model accuracy was validated in an independent patient group.

It supported the claim that newly acquired HBV infection is in association with better outcomes of antiviral therapy. Having a positive family history indicates that patients may be infected with HBV for a long time. On the contrary, patients without family history are more likely to have a shorter duration of infection. So family history may have a prognostic value, and was confirmed to be a predictor of early virological response in the present study. To our surprise, however age and history of HBV infection were not identified as predictive factors in our study, but many of the patients may have infected with HBV long before the diagnosis was made. Therefore, the actual significance of age and HBV infection history in prognosis of telbivudine-treated patients is still to be determined. </offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33325" xml_f="34147" txt_i="17833" txt_f="18655">It is known by liver biopsy that active CHB patients with higher level of viral replication are more likely to respond to alpha-interferon therapy. As serum concentrations of bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) reflect the activity of chronic hepatitis B to a certain degree, it is easy to understand that the two factors were identified as predictors of the early virological response. However, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), which also reflects the grade of hepatitis activity on liver biopsy, was not found to be associated with early virological response in the present study. The possible explanation is that ALT is more susceptible than AST to be affected by some drugs. It was reported that CHB patients with lower level of HBV-DNA are more likely to respond to alpha-interferon and lamivudine therapy (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="A15573R27"><offsets xml_i="34185" xml_f="34187" txt_i="18655" txt_f="18657">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="34194" xml_f="34345" txt_i="18657" txt_f="18808">).

All these are objective and relatively stable variables. By combining the four variables with the partial regression coefficient, we developed a model to predict early virological response. That is, R = 1.158*LN (family history of HBV infection, 1 = Yes, 2 = no) + 0.055*LN (TBIL μmol/L) + 0.006*LN (ASTU/l) - 0.272*LN (log10HBVNDA IU/mL). The model was validated in an independent set of patients. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 73.3% (P = 0.044), and the optimal cut off value was -0.38403. It means that patients with R &gt; -0.38 are most likely to achieve early virological response to telbivudine therapy, or good outcomes of the treatment. Patients with R &gt; -0.38 are most suitable for telbivudine treatment in clinical practice.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="35210" xml_f="36343" txt_i="19655" txt_f="20788">The model and optimal cutoff value were established from a short-term follow-up study of only telbivudine-treated CHB patients, which makes the conclusion a little weaker. Whether the model and cutoff value can be applied to other nucleos(t)ide analogs therapy for CHB needs to be determined. Furthermore, developing a more accurate model and cutoff values to predict the outcome of telbivudine treatment in CHB patients requires a large-scale, multicenter and long-term follow-up study. But, in the present study, the data were all from a single center, with a small sample size and a short follow-up period (only 24 weeks). Lastly, route of HBV transmission (Horizontal vs. vertical)，and the viral characteristics (genotype, HBeAg status) could affect the predictive model. However, as the exact route of HBC transmission for each patient is rather difficult to determine, and also for economic reasons, these factors were not included in the study. Therefore, whether the model and optimal cutoff value can accurately predict the early virological response and long-term outcome of telbivudine treatment should be further studied.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Yu Shen for his English writing help.
