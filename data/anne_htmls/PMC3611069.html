In addition, it was reported that 40 mg or 125 mg of aprepitant had a better anti-vomiting and effect than 4 mg of ondansetron during the 48 hours after operation on patients who were receiving abdominal operations under general anesthesia. In addition, there was a better stabilizing effect and the QTC interval was not increased as well [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="19085" xml_f="19086" txt_i="13925" txt_f="13926">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19093" xml_f="19094" txt_i="13926" txt_f="13927">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13"><offsets xml_i="19126" xml_f="19128" txt_i="13927" txt_f="13929">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="19135" xml_f="19755" txt_i="13929" txt_f="14549">]. In this study, the additional administration of aprepitant revealed more significance statistically in the anti-nausea effect rather than in the anti-vomiting effect. It is inferred that this is because the subjects of the study were chosen among those who did not have a relatively high degree of risk of PONV and so the rate of occurrence of vomiting and retching in all groups was low. Nevertheless, the result that the additive administration of aprepitant 125 mg with ondanseteron 4 mg can reduce nausea distress after operations among patients who have a low degree of risk of PONV is significant in this study.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19762" xml_f="19776" txt_i="14550" txt_f="14564">Since the 5-HT</offsets><sub><offsets xml_i="19781" xml_f="19782" txt_i="14564" txt_f="14565">3</offsets></sub><offsets xml_i="19788" xml_f="20029" txt_i="14565" txt_f="14806"> receptor antagonist was developed and first applied, it has been selected as the ideal drug for nausea distress and vomiting and has been the most used standard drug up to the present for nausea distress and vomiting.

Thus, since it is difficult to prevent PONV with a single method, a diversified approach is required. First, the fundamental cause that creates PONV must be eliminated. Local anesthesia rather than general anesthesia must be performed and total intravenous anesthesia using propofol rather than inhalation anesthetics or nitrous oxide must be utilized. The use of narcotic analgesics for pain control during anesthesia or after operations must be minimized as well. Combined administration of a different type of drug that reacts differently to patients with high risk of PONV is recommended since the effect is increased. The drugs that have had their effect on PONV verified at the present are the 5-HT</offsets><sub><offsets xml_i="20871" xml_f="20872" txt_i="15593" txt_f="15594">3</offsets></sub><offsets xml_i="20878" xml_f="21329" txt_i="15594" txt_f="16045"> receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and droperidol. Two or three combinations of these drugs are recommended. According to a recent report, when comparing the preventive effects of PONV of the NK1 receptor antagonists casopitant and ondanseron after laparoscopic operation, the combined administration of 50 mg, 100 mg and 150 mg of casopitant with ondansetron had more outstanding results than the group in which ondansetron was administered alone [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="21361" xml_f="21363" txt_i="16045" txt_f="16047">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21370" xml_f="21603" txt_i="16047" txt_f="16280">]. In addition, it was reported from a comparison of the administration of aprepitant and dexamethasone and the combination of dexamethasone and ondansetron, that aprepitant showed much more of a combination effect than ondansetron [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"><offsets xml_i="21635" xml_f="21637" txt_i="16280" txt_f="16282">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="21644" xml_f="21813" txt_i="16282" txt_f="16451">].

This reveals that PONV can be effectively prevented through the combined administration of these two drugs. However, since the subject patients did not have a high degree of risk of PONV, additional research on patients with high risk of PONV is needed. In addition, since all patients in this study, with the exception of one patient, did not complain of PONV 6 hours after the operations, it was useless to observe them past a period of 48 hours. This type of study must be designed additionally on subject patients with many risk factors of PONV. 7 out of 24 patients who were solely administered with ondansetron complained of PONV, and this is not a low incidence. Therefore, there must be consideration given to the combination of drugs of another mechanism for the prevention of PONV for high PONV risk patients.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="22837" xml_f="23302" txt_i="17463" txt_f="17928">In conclusion, the rate of occurrence of PONV was lower for patients who were jointly administered with ondansetron and 125 mg of aprepitant compared to the control group that was only administered ondansetron. Furthermore, there were less patients who were given the rescue drug and there were no particular side effects among those who were jointly administered both of these drugs.
