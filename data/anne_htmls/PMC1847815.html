Within this context, the Pretreatment Intervention emphasizes a supportive environment for African-American participants, education in the process of becoming a substance abuse treatment patient, and help in understanding the concepts of recovery. The intervention paradigm supports the conceptual framework with a four-stage approach consisting of (1) the patient's awareness of a problem, (2) the patient's understanding of how to fix the problem, (3) an open attitude to change on the part of the patient, and (4) behavior or action that shows positive movement [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16"><offsets xml_i="16725" xml_f="16727" txt_i="11710" txt_f="11712">16</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="16734" xml_f="16736" txt_i="11712" txt_f="11714">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16743" xml_f="16964" txt_i="11715" txt_f="11936">This paradigm forms the basis for translating the conceptual framework into a workable protocol to enhance treatment readiness through a variety of well-known intervention strategies, including motivational interviewing [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39"><offsets xml_i="16996" xml_f="16998" txt_i="11936" txt_f="11938">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17005" xml_f="17024" txt_i="11938" txt_f="11957">], role induction [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40"><offsets xml_i="17056" xml_f="17058" txt_i="11957" txt_f="11959">40</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17065" xml_f="17066" txt_i="11959" txt_f="11960">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42"><offsets xml_i="17098" xml_f="17100" txt_i="11960" txt_f="11962">42</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17107" xml_f="17138" txt_i="11962" txt_f="11993">], and social skills building [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43"><offsets xml_i="17170" xml_f="17172" txt_i="11993" txt_f="11995">43</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17179" xml_f="17180" txt_i="11995" txt_f="11996">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44"><offsets xml_i="17212" xml_f="17214" txt_i="11996" txt_f="11998">44</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17221" xml_f="17320" txt_i="11998" txt_f="12097">].

Three African-American individuals (one male and two females) who were indigenous to the community and in substance abuse recovery were hired and trained to deliver the intervention. The sessions were designed to increase treatment readiness and motivation, to assist in reducing external barriers to treatment entry, and to increase understanding of the patient's role in treatment induction and the treatment process.

This personalized assessment of drug use, sexual risk, and treatment history allowed participants to develop an individualized plan of action to reduce risk behaviors and enter drug treatment based on their unique life situation.

Comparisons were made on demographics and drug use between individuals who completed both Part 1 and Part 2 (the current sample), and the 104 individuals who completed only Part 1 of the baseline. There were no significant differences in gender, age, education, homelessness, daily crack use, or daily alcohol use. Analyses of the intervention effect included individuals who were randomly assigned and completed either the 3-month or the 6-month follow-up. Ninety percent of the sample completed the 3-month follow-up (n = 400) and 89% completed the 6-month follow-up (n = 396).

This was coded as a dichotomous variable (yes-no). Treatment initiation at the 3-month follow-up was assessed from three items that asked respondents if they made an appointment with a drug treatment program, tried to enter a treatment program, or entered a treatment program in the past 90 days. A yes response to any of these items was considered treatment initiation. This was coded as a dichotomous variable (yes-no). Treatment initiation at 6 months was measured using these three items from the 3-month and the 6-month follow-ups. If individuals responded positively to any of these three items at the 3-month or the 6-month follow-up, they were coded as yes for the 6-month follow-up. Crack use at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months was measured as the number of days crack was used in the past 30 days. Three measures of alcohol use were examined. Alcohol frequency was measured as the number of days of alcohol use in the past 30 days. Alcohol quantity was measured as the number of days an individual drank five or more drinks in one day in the past 30 days, and the number of drinks per day in the past 30 days.

Initation was defined as making an appointment, attempting to enter treatment or entering treatment.

The relatively large difference between participants in the intervention group who initiated treatment (20%) and those who actually entered treatment (7.5%) suggests a need for structural changes that reduce treatment program barriers.

Although interviews were conducted by interviewers experienced in working with this population and trained in techniques for minimizing socially desirable responses, some responses may be inaccurate because of faulty memory or intentional misreporting. In addition, although a targeted sampling approach was used to increase generalizability, it is not possible to determine the representativeness of the sample; so caution should be used in generalizing these findings to other groups of crack abusers. Fifty-six participants reported a history of injection drug use, but only reported injecting in the past 30 days. Consequently, caution should used in generalizing these findings to IDUs that use crack.

Additionally, qualitative interviews with a small number of participants (n = 18) as well as anecdotal reports from field staff strongly suggest that simply coming to the study's field study office was important for participants in the control group. Qualitative data also suggest that many participants in the intervention group felt that the intervention was "treatment" – or at least a satisfactory substitution for it – and that most participants felt they could not commit to treatment given the individual and structural treatment barriers they faced. Nonetheless, both groups reported significant reductions in crack use. However the goal to access treatment for the experimental group was mixed. Although there were significant findings in initiation, access was still problematic due to structural barriers from the treatment programs even for those attempting to enter.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="46984" xml_f="47633" txt_i="32928" txt_f="33577">Because crack abuse continues in many poor communities, outreach and pretreatment sites may offer policy makers options for initiating treatment and reducing drug use. Determining the costs of such a site and identifying the essential elements of a brief pretreatment intervention, similar to the drop-in centers of years past, may be an important next step to understanding the feasibility of this strategy to reduce barriers to treatment. It is unclear whether site, staff, intervention, or even instrumentation components have an effect. Positive changes occur, but it remains difficult to disentangle which components are the most critical ones.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="47655" xml_f="47674" txt_i="33579" txt_f="33598">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47685" xml_f="47745" txt_i="33599" txt_f="33659">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="47767" xml_f="47789" txt_i="33661" txt_f="33683">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47800" xml_f="48255" txt_i="33684" txt_f="34139">WW was the Principal Investigator and conceptualized the study, supervised the field and research activities and all staff, and finalized the manuscript.
