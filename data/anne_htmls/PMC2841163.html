Effective face-to-face treatments are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) and Problem Solving Treatment (PST). However, about two-thirds of persons who die by suicide have not been in contact with mental health care services in the preceding year, and many have never been treated. Furthermore, many patients do not disclose their suicidal thoughts to their care provider. This may be out of shame, due to fear of stigma or due to lack of trust in (mental) health care. Since many suicidal individuals seek information online, the internet provides an opportunity to reach suicidal individuals who would not be contacted otherwise. By providing a self-help intervention online, persons can anonymously learn to gain control over their suicidal thoughts. There is convincing evidence that self-help is effective for a number of mental disorders.

To our knowledge, this is the first self-help application targeted specifically at suicidal thoughts. This aspect simultaneously might give rise to the idea that focusing mainly on suicidal thoughts could instigate suicidal thoughts or even suicidal behaviour. Even though this is a widespread belief, this idea is not validated in psychology or psychiatry [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55"><offsets xml_i="32195" xml_f="32197" txt_i="25784" txt_f="25786">55</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="32204" xml_f="32206" txt_i="25786" txt_f="25788">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="32213" xml_f="32401" txt_i="25789" txt_f="25977">The described study design has several methodological limitations.

This makes it impossible to diagnose psychiatric disorders, but is in keeping with the self-help character of the intervention. It is also in accordance with the eventual purpose of use, since the intervention will become available for people with suicidal thoughts in general, irrespective of the presence of a possible psychiatric disorder. A feature of the described design that decreases the generalizability to this target group, is that severe suicidal and severe depressed subjects are excluded. The rationale for this is that they need more extensive care.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33448" xml_f="33604" txt_i="26928" txt_f="27084">One of the strengths of this study lies in the design itself since the number of randomized controlled trails concerning suicidality is relatively limited [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="33636" xml_f="33638" txt_i="27084" txt_f="27086">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33645" xml_f="33646" txt_i="27086" txt_f="27087">,</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57"><offsets xml_i="33678" xml_f="33680" txt_i="27087" txt_f="27089">57</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33687" xml_f="33829" txt_i="27089" txt_f="27231">].

As a result, there still is a paucity of information on the effectiveness of treatments for suicidal persons. The present study can contribute to increasing knowledge on this subject. A second and related unique aspect of this study is that suicidal thoughts are the primary target of the intervention. Often, suicidal thoughts are treated as part of a depression. However, suicidal thoughts not only occur in depression, but are related to many mental disorders.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34358" xml_f="34377" txt_i="27701" txt_f="27720">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34388" xml_f="34446" txt_i="27721" txt_f="27779">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="34468" xml_f="34490" txt_i="27781" txt_f="27803">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="34501" xml_f="34790" txt_i="27804" txt_f="28093">AK obtained funding for this study.
