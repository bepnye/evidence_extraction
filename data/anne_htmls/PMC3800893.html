It is the most common cause of job related disability leading to missed work and second most common neurological ailment. As per the modern management is concerned, there is no established treatment for it, except surgical intervention, which cause complications and side effects. The present study has focus on the effectiveness of panchkarma combined with shamana therapies.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st2"><title><offsets xml_i="3324" xml_f="3331" txt_i="509" txt_f="516">Method:</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="3342" xml_f="3975" txt_i="517" txt_f="1150">The study was conducted in 100 clinically diagnosed patients of vertebral disc lesions. These patients were randomly selected and divided in to two groups. I. Patients having cervical lesion were kept on Panchkarma (Udvartan and Valukasveda Snehan, Swedan, Vamankarm, Tiktksheer Basti, Greevabasti, Nasyakarma.) II. Patients having lumbar lesions ware kept on (Udvartan and Valukasveda Snehan, Swedan, Virechankarm, Tiktaksheer basti, Katibasti, Nasyakarma.)After that both groups were kept on oral drugs such as Tab. Arogyavardhini-250mg BID, and Tab. Panchtiktakgrithguggul-250mg BID. With local abhyanga and nadisveda for 1 month.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st3"><title><offsets xml_i="4006" xml_f="4013" txt_i="1152" txt_f="1159">Result:</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4024" xml_f="4321" txt_i="1160" txt_f="1457">The patient was assessed after completion of treatment and follow up was done. The incidence of presenting features was worked out and the severities of the symptom were recorded statistically in each case and data were analysed. Both groups showed improvement in signs and symptoms significantly.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="st4"><title><offsets xml_i="4352" xml_f="4363" txt_i="1459" txt_f="1470">Conclusion:</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="4374" xml_f="4771" txt_i="1471" txt_f="1868">Vertebral disc lesions are progressive degenerative conditions in which vata at its own Ashaya (Asthi-Sandhi) gets provoked and as it belongs to Madhyam Rogamarga treatment becomes challenging. This attempt possibly finds solutions which can delay or even prevent surgical intervenation as sandhis are sites of Marma. It is an effective, simple, safe, treatment modality for vertebral disc lesion.</offsets></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
