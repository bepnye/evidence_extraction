The incidence of vitamin D deficiency during infancy had been decreased in the past with the improvement of nutritional condition such as vitamin D supplementation in infant formula. But, lately it has been increased again for various reasons such as breast-feeding from vitamin D deficient mother, lack of sun-light exposure (cosmetic or dermatologic reasons, sun-block, etc.), high latitude, dark skin, and low dietary intake of vitamin D, etc. (</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="7292" xml_f="7293" txt_i="2518" txt_f="2519">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7300" xml_f="7301" txt_i="2519" txt_f="2520">-</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><offsets xml_i="7333" xml_f="7335" txt_i="2520" txt_f="2522">10</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7342" xml_f="7536" txt_i="2522" txt_f="2716">).
