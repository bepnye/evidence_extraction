Firstly, fewer patients than planned completed the study, largely due to adverse events unrelated to study medication and more related to the elderly nature of the group. This may have reduced our power. Nonetheless, our pre-study assumptions (baseline TTPG of 46 mmHg, placebo group increase of 3 mmHg per annum and a standard deviation of the change from baseline of 16 mmHg) were not far from those observed (baseline TTPG of 43 mmHg, placebo increase of 5 mmHg per annum and standard deviation of 16.8 mmHg) We conclude therefore that a change of this magnitude is unlikely in the group as a whole. A much larger study would be needed to confidently detect or exclude a smaller effect. There does appear to be a greater proportionate effect on TTPF in patients with higher baseline values raising the possibility of further study in this group.
