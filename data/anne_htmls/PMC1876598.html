These improvements could come about as a result of embedding software within a medical record system that alerts clinicians to evidence that is relevant to the care they are providing. For example, such a system might deliver a pop-up reminder that informs a clinician about a potential prescribing error, or that the prescription ordered is not supported by recent evidence. Systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials evaluating the benefits of such systems have shown that computerized feedback and reminder systems can improve clinician behavior. However, much of this evidence comes from academic clinics caring for adults, and there is not very much evidence available on children or from community-based, nonacademic clinical practices. The researchers here wanted to evaluate whether a computerized system providing clinical decision support at the time of electronic prescribing could improve prescribing in pediatric primary care. In order to test this, the researchers carried out a cluster randomized trial. This means that individual health-care providers were randomized to receive evidence-based prompts via the computerized system or not, depending on which arm of the trial they were randomized to, but outcome data for the trial were collected at the level of the individual patient's prescription. Pop-up prompts were provided for eight medical conditions common in pediatric primary care, and alerted the provider to a summary of the evidence that supported or refuted the prescription that the provider was about to make. The primary outcome in the trial was the change in proportion of prescriptions dispensed in accordance with evidence, over the course of the trial.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="8561" xml_f="8562" txt_i="3529" txt_f="3530">

At the start of the trial, 38% of prescriptions in the intervention group were in accordance with the evidence, and 39% of prescriptions in the control group. At the end of the trial, 42% of prescriptions in the intervention group were in accordance with evidence, as compared to 40% of prescriptions in the control group. The difference in prescribing behavior change over the course of the trial between intervention and control groups was statistically significant, once adjusted for the clustering of data by the individual providers.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9328" xml_f="9329" txt_i="4277" txt_f="4278">

This method (cluster randomization) is probably the most appropriate method to carry out a trial such as this, because it reduces the chance of contamination (i.e., that patients not assigned to the intervention might receive some of its benefits). One limitation is the small number of providers that were recruited into the trial; another is that many of these in fact practiced or had recently practiced in academic medicine rather than community-based, nonacademic clinical practices. This limits the ability to generalize from these findings to a nonacademic setting. Finally, the trial was planned with the intention of evaluating the ability of computerized systems to achieve health-care provider behavior change. Therefore, data were analyzed by lumping together outcomes for many different medical conditions. This means that the computerized prompt system may not necessarily have been that successful in achieving improvements in prescribing for any individual condition.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="10435" xml_f="10436" txt_i="5365" txt_f="5366">

In the original intervention, a provider wishing to change from diphenhydramine to fluticasone would have had to close out the alert screen, cancel the diphenhydramine prescription, and then begin the fluticasone prescription. With the one-click option, a provider was able instead to click a button that closed both the alert page and the diphenhydramine prescription, and automatically completed a weight-based fluticasone prescription.

First, it controlled for each provider's individual prescribing practices, and second, it reduced the random variance in the outcome measure, affording our analysis greater power. Because we measured the outcomes as a change in individual behavior, it was not necessary to control for provider-specific potential confounders. To test the primary hypothesis we used weighted regression analyses, controlled for clustering by provider, to test the difference in behavior change between the treatment and control groups.

In this regard, future evaluations might focus on trying to effect behavior change for some particular conditions that, for example, drive a large proportion of health-care costs, or are associated with substantial need for prescribing improvement.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38445" xml_f="38903" txt_i="29258" txt_f="29716">While for many conditions prescribing behavior improved, we found that antibiotic prescribing for otitis media increased for providers in both the intervention and controlgroups, counter to the evidence provided in the intervention. Our intervention served primarily to slow the tide towards increased prescribing.

We found that for some conditions there was a delay before the message screens achieved their fullest impact. Technological problems early in the study may have decreased early adoption of the system, or alternatively, providers may have needed time and repeated exposure to the evidence-based messages before they changed their behavior, especially behavior most ingrained such as for otitis media. The second subanalysis assessed our attempt to streamline electronic prescribing.

This one-click option was introduced in the latter half of the study, and it may be that the intervention had already achieved its maximal effect in changing prescribing practices.

One of our two sites was situated within a large academic medical center, while the other clinic was populated by many recent graduates of this same site.

Following Bennett and Glasziou's scheme, our trial is most comparable to a total of 11 other trials that have assessed provider reminders in outpatient settings. Of these 11, the evidence is quite divided in terms of showing effectiveness: five of the studies showed positive effects while six did not.
