By giving all subjects in the experiment the same context in which to examine behavioural intention, we have eliminated these two sources of variation. Therefore, if we use the same outcome in both the trial and in the IME, we would expect its standard deviation to be smaller in the IME than in the trial. Thus, a given shift in outcome (difference between two groups) represents a much larger effect size (difference in outcome divided by the standard deviation) in the IME than in the trial. Thus, if a trial were to produce a moderate effect size we might expect a large effect size in the IME. The IME will be powered to detect difference between each of the active intervention groups and the control group. Using standard methods for a continuous outcome, we need 50 subjects per group to have 80% power of detecting an effect size of 0.8 using a significance level of 2.5%, giving a total sample size of 200 for the experiment. We will over-sample, using an initial sample of 800, to ensure that we achieve this final sample size. This will be adjusted in the light of the impact of the incentive. Groups will be compared using methods appropriate for comparing independent samples (t-tests to compare two groups, analysis of covariance to compare groups adjusting for differences in baseline performance).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="28523" xml_f="28538" txt_i="20994" txt_f="21009">Ethics approval</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="28549" xml_f="28681" txt_i="21010" txt_f="21142">The study has ethical approval from the Northern and Yorkshire Multi-Centre Research Ethics committee.
