Costs directly related to falls were collected during the trial by research assistants who were blinded to group allocation. The costs of providing investigations, treatments and subsequent care for people specifically due to a fall were valued for this category of costs. Time spent completing nursing and medical assessments and associated documentation in medical records (if documented as having been completed specifically because of the fall and not as a part of routine ward reviews) were estimated to be 15 minutes per fall for uncomplicated falls, 30 minutes per fall where injuries were noted, and were valued using local wage rates (resident medical officer rate [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="20845" xml_f="20847" txt_i="13690" txt_f="13692">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20854" xml_f="20955" txt_i="13692" txt_f="13793">], level 1 year 5 nursing officer (equivalent to a nurse with 5 years of experience) pay scale rate [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23"><offsets xml_i="20987" xml_f="20989" txt_i="13793" txt_f="13795">23</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="20996" xml_f="22393" txt_i="13795" txt_f="15192">]) for the relevant staff. These wage rates were inflated (multiplied by 1.3) to account for on-costs (for example, sick leave and annual leave entitlements). Time required to provide additional nursing assessments as a result of the fall (for example, hourly neurological observations for 24 hours) were estimated by consulting with local hospital staff and were valued using the level 1 year 5 nursing officer pay scale. Costs of providing specific radiological investigations were valued using market rates from the private sector. If a patient on a rehabilitation ward fell and injured themselves resulting in an admission to an acute ward not included in the study, then the length of stay and admission diagnosis for that admission was recorded and valued using the Weighted Inlier Equivalent Separation casemix valuation approach as previously described. It was considered important to include these ‘additional’ costs that were directly related to falls in this analysis and in the calculation of the cost per fall estimate as the Weighted Inlier Equivalent Separation (acute wards) and per diem payment systems are not sensitive to the additional workload created by falls beyond additional length of stay at an individual patient level.

Patients who fall may stay longer in hospital to treat the injuries they sustain as a direct result of the fall. Thus, the first assumption employed was that the greater length of stay observed among fallers, after adjusting for other factors that might contribute to longer length of stay, are entirely due to the falls observed. Under this assumption, a cohort-style analysis approach was pursued where regression analyses were undertaken using total costs (length of stay costs plus costs directly related to falls) as the dependent variable and faller status (0 = non-faller, 1 = faller: to estimate cost per faller) or number of falls (to estimate cost per fall) as independent variables along with confounders of age, gender, admission diagnosis grouping, whether there was admission to a rehabilitation ward, admission health-related quality of life, and history of falls in the 6 months prior to hospital admission. Three regression analysis approaches were used to estimate this amount: linear regression analysis, linear regression analysis with removal of outlier data points (more than 3 standard deviations higher than the mean), and robust regression which first performs an initial screening based on Cook’s distance &gt;1 to eliminate gross outliers before calculating starting values and then performs Huber iterations followed by bi-weight iterations in calculating regression coefficients (again to minimize the influence of outliers) [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"><offsets xml_i="24726" xml_f="24728" txt_i="17454" txt_f="17456">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="24735" xml_f="25567" txt_i="17456" txt_f="18288">]. However, patients who would otherwise have a longer length of stay in hospital may be more likely to be observed to fall during an admission as a consequence of being observed for a longer period of time. Further, a latent (unobserved) variable may be responsible for both the increased length of stay and occurrence of falls that cannot be adjusted for in the regression analyses described above. Therefore burden of disease estimates that excluded costs associated with greater length of stay in fallers under the assumption that they do not cause an increase in length of stay were also calculated. Here the costs directly related to falls were summed and then divided by the number of fallers (to calculate the cost per faller) or divided by the total number of falls (to calculate the incremental cost per incremental fall).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="25589" xml_f="25658" txt_i="18290" txt_f="18359">Incremental cost effectiveness using randomized controlled trial data</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="25669" xml_f="26821" txt_i="18360" txt_f="19512">The incremental cost-effectiveness analysis examined the cost per fall prevented and cost per faller prevented of providing the complete education program as opposed to usual care among cognitively intact patients in the randomized trial.

Elimination of outliers 3 standard deviations higher than the mean led to removal of 29 ‘high cost’ participants.

Where the middle cost per faller estimate of A$2,867 was used along with the effectiveness of the intervention program estimate taken from the randomized trial (40% reduction), the complete program appeared to both prevent more falls and cost less than usual care alone from the health service perspective as long as at least 4.0% of cognitively intact patients on a ward were fallers under usual care conditions during their admission. If more conservative estimates of intervention effectiveness were used, then a higher proportion of patients falling under usual care conditions was required (5.3% if the intervention reduced fallers by 30%, 8.0% if the intervention reduced fallers by only 20%). The intervention program did not demonstrate lower costs than usual care in any scenario modeled when the lower cost per faller estimate of A$58 was used.

If the proportion of cognitively intact patients falling on a ward under usual care conditions is 4% or greater, then provision of the complete program in addition to usual care will likely both prevent falls and reduce costs for a health service. Three key caveats should be noted in this recommendation. First, this recommendation is sensitive to the different values of the cost per faller modeled. These estimates were only developed from the health service perspective and were limited to the period of inpatient hospitalization. Costs of care post hospitalization and non-health costs (including legal costs) would add to these estimates. Second, the effectiveness of the program has been derived from a randomized trial conducted across two hospitals in Australia and is relative to the standard of usual care provided in these settings [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><offsets xml_i="62896" xml_f="62898" txt_i="38736" txt_f="38738">11</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="62905" xml_f="63852" txt_i="38738" txt_f="39685">]. It is plausible that usual care provided in these sites may be different to other hospitals around the world. Both of these hospitals had falls prevention interventions in place as a part of usual care including use of falls risk screening/assessment tools, provision of falls risk alert signage, nursing falls care plans and provision of multiple allied health therapies including physiotherapy. However, the principle illustrated in our analyses that the cost effectiveness of an in-hospital falls prevention intervention depends heavily on the rate of falls under usual care conditions would still transfer beyond the Australian context. Third, this recommendation assumes no further ‘falls risk screening’ or selective targeting of this intervention to those at higher risk of falls within the targeted population. Previous research indicates that this may lead to greater economic efficiency in delivery of falls prevention interventions [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><offsets xml_i="63884" xml_f="63886" txt_i="39685" txt_f="39687">14</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="63893" xml_f="63895" txt_i="39687" txt_f="39689">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="63902" xml_f="64309" txt_i="39690" txt_f="40097">The ‘cost per fall’ and ‘cost per faller’ figures developed using the cohort approach in the present study differed substantially due to different assumptions regarding the effect of falls on length of stay.

This indicates that the higher value calculated in the present study may be more accurate, though the authors feel that a value between these extremes is plausible as it is likely that falls may cause some increase in length of stay, but not all of that observed. The value extrapolated from previous work did sit within this range and thus formed the basis for the recommendation provided, even though it was closer to the lower cost per faller estimate than the higher. This value, through the modeling and sensitivity analyses, also generated the closest approximation to the cost-effectiveness ratios seen from the primary randomized trial data.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="65116" xml_f="65868" txt_i="40820" txt_f="41572">This study was limited in the precision with which it could construct incremental cost-effectiveness ratios directly from the primary randomized controlled trial data.
