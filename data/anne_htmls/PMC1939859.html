Faced with a patient with high blood pressure (hypertension), for example, the doctor had to decide whether to recommend lifestyle changes or to prescribe drugs to reduce the blood pressure. If he or she chose the latter, he or she then had to decide which drug to prescribe, set a target blood pressure, and decide how long to wait before changing the prescription if this target was not reached. But, over the past decade, numerous clinical practice guidelines have been produced by governmental bodies and medical associations to help doctors make treatment decisions like these. For each guideline, experts have searched the medical literature for the current evidence about the diagnosis and treatment of a disease, evaluated the quality of that evidence, and then made recommendations based on the best evidence available.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb2"><title><offsets xml_i="7306" xml_f="7330" txt_i="2731" txt_f="2755">Why Was This Study Done?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7341" xml_f="8871" txt_i="2756" txt_f="4286">The recommendations made in different clinical practice guidelines vary, in part because they are based on evidence of varying quality. To help clinicians decide which recommendations to follow, some guidelines indicate the strength of their recommendations by grading them, based on the methods used to collect the underlying evidence. Thus, a randomized clinical trial (RCT)—one in which patients are randomly allocated to different treatments without the patient or clinician knowing the allocation—provides higher-quality evidence than a nonrandomized trial. Similarly, internally valid trials—in which the differences between patient groups are solely due to their different treatments and not to other aspects of the trial—provide high-quality evidence. However, grading schemes rarely consider the size of studies and whether they have focused on clinical or so-called “surrogate” measures. (For example, an RCT of a treatment to reduce heart or circulation [“cardiovascular”] problems caused by high blood pressure might have death rate as a clinical measure; a surrogate endpoint would be blood pressure reduction.) Most guidelines also do not consider how generalizable (applicable) the results of a trial are to the populations, interventions, and outcomes specified in the guideline recommendation. In this study, the researchers have investigated the quality of the evidence underlying recommendations for cardiovascular risk management in nine evidence-based clinical practice guides using these additional criteria.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb3"><title><offsets xml_i="8902" xml_f="8939" txt_i="4288" txt_f="4325">What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="8950" xml_f="10241" txt_i="4326" txt_f="5617">The researchers extracted the recommendations for managing cardiovascular risk from the current US, Canadian, and European guidelines for the management of diabetes, abnormal blood lipid levels (dyslipidemia), and hypertension. They graded the quality of evidence for each recommendation using the Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP) grading scheme, which considers the type of study, its internal validity, its clinical relevance, and how generally applicable the evidence is considered to be. Of 338 evidence-based recommendations, two-thirds were based on evidence collected in internally valid RCTs, but only half of these RCT-based recommendations were based on high-quality evidence. The evidence underlying 64 of the guideline recommendations failed to achieve a high CHEP grade because the RCT data were collected in a population of people with different characteristics to those covered by the guideline. For example, a recommendation to use spironolactone to reduce blood pressure in people with hypertension was based on an RCT in which the participants initially had congestive heart failure with normal blood pressure. Another 59 recommendations were downgraded because they were based on evidence from RCTs that had not focused on clinical measures of effectiveness.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb4"><title><offsets xml_i="10272" xml_f="10300" txt_i="5619" txt_f="5647">What Do These Findings Mean?</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="10311" xml_f="11215" txt_i="5648" txt_f="6552">These findings indicate that although most of the recommendations for cardiovascular risk management therapies in the selected guidelines were based on evidence collected in internally valid RCTs, less than one-third were based on high-quality evidence applicable to the populations, treatments, and outcomes specified in guideline recommendations. A limitation of this study is that it analyzed a subset of recommendations in only a few guidelines. Nevertheless, the findings serve to warn clinicians that evidence-based guidelines are not necessarily based on high-quality evidence. In addition, they emphasize the need to make the evidence base underlying guideline recommendations more transparent by using an extended grading system like the CHEP scheme. If this were done, the researchers suggest, it would help clinicians apply guideline recommendations appropriately to their individual patients.</offsets></p></sec><sec id="sb5"><title><offsets xml_i="11246" xml_f="11269" txt_i="6554" txt_f="6577">Additional Information.</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="11280" xml_f="11352" txt_i="6578" txt_f="6650">Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040250"><offsets xml_i="11442" xml_f="11488" txt_i="6650" txt_f="6696">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040250</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="11499" xml_f="11500" txt_i="6696" txt_f="6697">.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11507" xml_f="11537" txt_i="6698" txt_f="6728">• Wikipedia contains pages on </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"><offsets xml_i="11633" xml_f="11656" txt_i="6728" txt_f="6751">evidence-based medicine</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="11667" xml_f="11675" txt_i="6751" txt_f="6759"> and on </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guideline_(medical)"><offsets xml_i="11767" xml_f="11795" txt_i="6759" txt_f="6787">clinical practice guidelines</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="11806" xml_f="11907" txt_i="6787" txt_f="6888"> (note: Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="11914" xml_f="11977" txt_i="6889" txt_f="6952">• The National Guideline Clearinghouse provides information on </offsets><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.guideline.gov/"><offsets xml_i="12046" xml_f="12068" txt_i="6952" txt_f="6974">US national guidelines</offsets></ext-link><offsets xml_i="12079" xml_f="12080" txt_i="6974" txt_f="6975">

The term may be interpreted differently depending on who is referring to the guideline—the developer, who creates the guidelines, or the clinician, who uses them.

In a similar vein, other investigators have recently questioned whether the evidence cited in the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program, or NCEP III, as support for recommendations to use statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is directly applicable, since one-tenth of the patients in the 16 “primary prevention” trials cited in that guideline had cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease at baseline [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0040250-b024" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="33784" xml_f="33786" txt_i="24190" txt_f="24192">24</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="33793" xml_f="33795" txt_i="24192" txt_f="24194">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="33802" xml_f="34195" txt_i="24195" txt_f="24588">As a corollary, it is evident that while a particular RCT may be used as the basis for multiple recommendations, RCTs will not provide the same quality of evidence for each recommendation (and in some cases guideline developers may extrapolate beyond the limits of the evidence in making particular recommendations).

However, our unique finding is that even those recommendations in evidence-based guidelines that cite internally valid RCTs as support may not be underpinned by high-quality evidence.

While the guidelines we studied were published at different times, the range was narrow (2003–2006) and our study focused on the type of evidence cited by each guideline rather than by the specific recommendations made.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37173" xml_f="37878" txt_i="26856" txt_f="27561">Despite a number of strengths, our study has some limitations. First, we did not systematically search for different guidelines, but instead examined only a small sample of guidelines; future studies should expand our work to explore the quality of evidence underlying guidelines in other topic areas. For example, we believe a systematic examination of all guidelines produced by a particular organization (or, alternatively, all published guidelines in a particular topic area) would provide useful additional insights. To do so, we advocate the use of explicit grading schemes such as those of CHEP or GRADE (as in the recently reported framework for World Health Organization Rapid Advice Guidelines [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0040250-b038" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="37924" xml_f="37926" txt_i="27561" txt_f="27563">38</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37933" xml_f="39747" txt_i="27563" txt_f="29377">]). However, while we found a high degree of inter-rater reliability for assessing whether RCT evidence was high quality or not (kappa 0.78 after all investigators completed a training set), future studies should also assess the inter-rater reliability scores for the GRADE or CHEP schemes if used by investigators less familiar with the schemes. Second, because the guidelines were inconsistent in how they cited studies in support of therapy recommendations (with some providing the citation directly with the recommendation and others providing numerous citations at the end of supporting text associated with recommendations), there is a potential risk we may have misattributed citations to particular recommendations. We attempted to minimize this risk by having two investigators extract recommendations and citations independently for each guideline and by always biasing in favor of the guideline (i.e., if several citations were attached to a recommendation, we assigned the highest evidence rating achieved by any of the studies to that recommendation). However, future researchers may want to consider prospectively surveying guideline developers to determine exactly which pieces of evidence are considered for each recommendation; also, documentation of the debate around the evidence for particular recommendations in different overlapping guidelines would provide potentially interesting insights. Finally, although our choice to restrict our analysis to cardiovascular therapy recommendations may be perceived as a limitation, it in fact strengthens our conclusions since therapy recommendations are those most likely to be based on RCT evidence. Thus, our findings represent a “best-case” scenario, insofar as very few preventive or diagnostic guideline recommendations are based on RCT evidence.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39754" xml_f="40528" txt_i="29378" txt_f="30152">In conclusion, our finding that less than one-third of treatment recommendations (and less than half of those citing RCTs in support of the advocated treatment) were based on high-quality evidence in national evidence-based guidelines for common conditions should sound a note of caution to consumers of clinical practice guidelines who assume that the sobriquet “evidence based” means that all recommendations contained therein are derived from high-quality evidence. In particular, we have documented that even evidence arising from internally valid RCTs may not be directly applicable to the populations, interventions, and outcomes specified in a guideline recommendation. As a recent editorial noted, “external validity is the neglected dimension in evidence ranking” [</offsets><xref rid="pmed-0040250-b039" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="40574" xml_f="40576" txt_i="30152" txt_f="30154">39</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="40583" xml_f="41242" txt_i="30154" txt_f="30813">]. Indeed, in order to make the evidence base underlying therapy recommendations more transparent in future guidelines, we advocate wider adoption of evidence-rating schemes (such as the CHEP system or the GRADE system) that go beyond just judging the internal validity of supporting evidence but also incorporate considerations of the clinical relevance and applicability of that evidence to the clinical scenario the recommendation is being made for. A clearer understanding of the strengths and limitations of the underlying evidence base will then permit clinicians to individualize the application of practice guideline recommendations to their patients.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>FAM, JAJ, and SRM are supported by the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).
