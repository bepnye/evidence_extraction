The study arm played an educational board game covering the same material from the optometric curriculum for an equal number of hours over a 2 consecutive day period (game group). Baseline knowledge of the subject material was assessed immediately prior to the intervention with a 40-question multiple choice examination. Immediately following the intervention a different 40-question multiple choice examination was administered to assess change in knowledge level. Both groups received their instruction concurrently, with instructors rotating between the lecture and game groups on separate days.

Each card contains 4 questions, one in each topic area, along with the correct answer. The questions used in this game are all short answer or fill-in-the-blank. All questions were written by the faculty and students of RSO, and were drawn from the core curriculum of the optometry school. The question topic is determined by the color of the space upon which the player’s game piece has landed. If the player answers the question correctly, he/she is awarded one point, and rolls the die a second time to advance his/her piece closer to the end of the board, but is not asked a second question. If the player answers incorrectly, no points are awarded and his/her turn ends immediately (he/she does not roll the die a second time). Players must answer questions from memory and are not allowed to consult notes or one another. The Judge is not allowed to offer hints or assist players in any other way in answering questions. Scratch paper and a calculator may be used by players, as needed. Players are allowed a maximum of 60 seconds to answer each question. The opinion of the Judge is final in the event of a dispute regarding whether the question has been answered correctly.

As an exploratory study of the effectiveness of the Optometry Knowledge Challenge, we had no preexisting data upon which to conduct statistical power calculations. Therefore, our sample size was determined solely by the number of students that volunteered for our study. Student’s t-test was used to analyze pre- and post-intervention examination scores. Confidence intervals for the mean post-intervention change in exam scores for the study and control groups were calculated. The lower limit of the 90% confidence interval of the study group’s mean exam score change was used to assess equivalence of the intervention with the control group. Differences in opinion survey responses were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U test and Kendall’s tau. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test for significant difference in the distribution of responses to each question between the game and lecture groups.

The high GPA group performed significantly better than the low GPA group on both baseline and post-intervention examinations. This concordance between cumulative GPA and performance on our examinations provides evidence that the exams are valid assessment instruments. Subjects with high GPA status demonstrated less post-intervention gain in exam scores than low GPA status subjects, but this only achieved statistical significance among the lecture group (game: p = 0.2; lecture: p = 0.02). The mean point gain for high GPA subjects was nearly identical for each intervention (game: 5.80±3.22; lecture 5.80±2.40, p = 1.0), but the low GPA subjects saw a mean 1 point larger gain in the lecture group than the game group (game: 8.00±3.16; lecture: 9.09±3.15, p = 0.4). We uncovered no exam performance differences between male and female subjects between the two arms of our study.</offsets></p><table-wrap id="pone.0156389.t003" orientation="portrait"

This possibility is supported by the finding that the low GPA students in the lecture group scored 0.36 points higher on the post-intervention exam than the low-GPA students in the game group despite being 0.73 points lower at baseline.
