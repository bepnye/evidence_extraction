The quality of ascertainment of depression occurring as an adverse event was quite uncertain. It is not evident that a major depressive disorder was always diagnosed by an expert when depression was listed as an adverse event. There are potential statistical pitfalls in compiling results of numerous trials of different design and duration using 4 different hypnotics. Because the FDA online files are a limited source, other methods of ascertainment might have uncovered more trials of these drugs, especially post-marketing trials.
