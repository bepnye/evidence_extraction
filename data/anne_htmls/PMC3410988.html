Given the status of memantine as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the preclinical evidence of potential efficacy in Ts65Dn mice, and the favorable safety profile of memantine, we designed a study to investigate whether the findings in the mouse model could be translated to individuals with DS. In this pilot, proof-of-principle study we hypothesized that memantine therapy would improve test scores of young adults with DS on measures of episodic and spatial memory, which are generally considered to be hippocampus dependent. Accordingly, in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we compared the effect of 16-week treatment with either memantine or placebo on cognitive and adaptive functions of 40 young adults with DS using a carefully selected set of neuropsychological outcome measures. Safety and tolerability were also monitored. Although no significant differences were observed between the memantine and placebo groups on the two primary outcome measures, we found a significant improvement in the memantine group in one of the secondary measures associated with the primary hypothesis. Only infrequent and mild adverse events were noted.</offsets></p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Alzheimer disease</kwd><kwd>Down syndrome</kwd><kwd>intellectual

One board-certified clinical neuropsychologist (RB) and two graduate research assistants experienced in the examination of individuals with intellectual disability (CH-L and AS; directly supervised by RB) tested all of the participants.

Participants were explained the nature of the evaluation in simple terms, and were told that no aspect of it would be painful. The caregiver remained in the room during the first two tasks administered, the second being the CVLT-II (California Verbal Learning Test-II). The caregiver sat in a corner of the room and did not engage with the participant during this time. The caregiver provided verification of verbal responses in case the participant's speech intelligibility was poor on an as-needed basis. Verbal responses during the CVLT-II were also tape recorded for later accuracy checks. The caregiver then left the room and completed an adaptive functioning questionnaire (Scales of Independent Behavior–Revised (SIB-R)) during the remainder of the 2-h testing period. Participants were given breaks as needed. All participants completed the test battery, with some needing increased prompting and verbal reinforcement to remain on task. The full version of the CVLT-II was administered to the first participant of the trial, and it became clear that the number of items was too great to obtain reliable data. The short form of the CVLT-II (which has 9 items instead of 16) was substituted from the second participant onward, and thus, the first participant has missing data for this particular test. The battery of tests was identical across the two time points. Alternate versions were only available for the computerized measures from the CANTAB (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery). Scoring of all of the tests was conducted by the tester and supervised by a licensed neuropsychologist (RB).</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="22079" xml_f="22095" txt_i="14884" txt_f="14900">Outcome measures</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="22106" xml_f="22187" txt_i="14901" txt_f="14982">The battery chosen for this trial mirrors closely that in the work of Pennington </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="22195" xml_f="22201" txt_i="14982" txt_f="14988">et al.</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="22210" xml_f="22211" txt_i="14988" txt_f="14989">,</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7"><offsets xml_i="22249" xml_f="22250" txt_i="14989" txt_f="14990">7</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="22263" xml_f="22691" txt_i="14990" txt_f="15418"> which carefully examined the neuropsychological profile of children with DS.

Only three subtests of the RBMT were used (that is, Route Learning, Message and Belonging tasks).

For most tests, this means that age norms were not applicable. Raw scores were used as dependent variables in almost all cases, with the exception of the DAS-II (Differential Ability Scales-II) Matrices and SIB-R tests. Because of the nature of the DAS-II Matrices subtest, where participants can be administered different sets of items based on basal and ceiling rules, an intermediate ‘Ability Score' derived from the Rasch scaling methodology of the test was used. This allows comparison among participants, but is not a developmental quotient or standard score.

This clinical trial involved two clinical laboratory tests per participant (baseline and treatment week 16). Electrocardiograms , with interpretation by Children's Cardiology Service, involved two 12-lead electrocardiograms per participant. Clinical consultations were performed either by a board-certified child neurologist (TB) or a board-certified pediatrician (EJG). The use of pediatricians in this pilot study can be justified by the ultimate goal of this research, which is to extend the use of memantine to the pediatric population, in which we are more likely to have a larger impact on improving the quality of life of individuals with DS. In addition, historically, pediatricians have had extensive experience in diagnosing and treating children with intellectual disabilities into adulthood. Finally, the neuropsychology team at the Children's Hospital Colorado has extensive experience in assessing the cognitive abilities of individuals of comparable mental age. The physical exam included a health questionnaire readdressing the study inclusion/exclusion criteria.

In healthy, typically developing individuals, it is generally assumed that successful verbal learning of a supraspan word list also depends on the development of a strategy, and should therefore rely on the frontal lobes as well. Finally, attention deficits or interference may also contribute to disturbed recall. In pathologic conditions, such as in amnesia or memory impairment, subjects are unlikely to develop alternative learning strategies, which make the test even more dependent on the functioning of hippocampus/medial temporal lobes. Indeed, there is general agreement on the role of the medial temporal lobes in episodic/long-term consolidation, and most researchers agree that verbal memory generally depends more on left-side structures.</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35"><offsets xml_i="50127" xml_f="50129" txt_i="39507" txt_f="39509">35</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="50142" xml_f="50674" txt_i="39509" txt_f="40041"> Although it would have been interesting to characterize serial position effects and subjective clustering strategies associated with the CVLT-II performance by individuals with DS in the present study, the use of the short form of the CVLT-II (which has 9 items instead of 16) has limited the potential usefulness of such analysis.

One of the consequences of this bias was the production of an ∼2:1 imbalance in the female/male ratio in our sample.

Although 1-year-long treatment with memantine was well tolerated in this participant cohort, efficacy data were completely negative. The design of the MEADOWS trial preceded many important recent findings in the field of DS research; therefore, it did not benefit from newly available information. For example, neuropsychological assessments of hippocampus-dependent measures were not included in the protocol. Additionally, it is plausible to assume that, by the time treatment began, various irreversible pathological cellular cascades were already triggered and the disease process might have reached a point of no return (see Costa</offsets><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39"><offsets xml_i="55569" xml_f="55571" txt_i="44558" txt_f="44560">39</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="55584" xml_f="55809" txt_i="44560" txt_f="44785"> for a more complete set of comments on the MEADOWS trial).

Finally, it would be important to explore the usefulness of electrophysiological, imaging and/or biochemical biomarkers in future studies. Such biomarkers would not only provide potential surrogate end points in addition to neuropsychological measures, but also might allow for a more inclusive recruitment in future studies.

The symbol ‘<sup>*</sup>' denotes the <italic>P-</italic>value of &lt;0.05 for the difference between T1 and T2 for the memantine group compared with the placebo group using MIXED models. Error bars represent mean and 90% confidence intervals. Note that the CVLT-II total free recall raw scores from 11 patients showed increases from T1 to T2, whereas this only happened for scores from 6 patients in the placebo group. Also, increases in score larger than 10 points only happened for the memantine group.
