Navigators also made initial reminder telephone calls to each patient one month prior to his scheduled prostate needle biopsy and utilized these calls to review procedure-related preparatory instructions, since lack of adherence to these instructions often resulted in a rescheduled appointment. For patients who could not be directly reached at their valid primary telephone number, navigators left a voicemail appointment reminder upon repeat contact. A second appointment reminder was made ten days prior to the scheduled biopsy to ensure that patients remained adherent to preparatory instructions. If the patient, through previous interaction with their navigator, expressed difficulty remembering appointment times, the navigator performed a third reminder call prior to the biopsy date.

It is well settled that an elevated PSA can represent several medical conditions beyond prostate cancer, including prostatitis and benign prostatic hypertrophy. PSA can also be artificially and transiently elevated by recent digital rectal examination, prostate needle biopsy, and recent sexual activity. Therefore, the limitations of an abnormal PSA test alone must be taken into consideration when implementing a navigation intervention. Our study adequately addressed this concern, as it focused on men whose prostate cancer screening results, history, and clinical presentation to the urologist reflected a high probability of prostate cancer, thus resulting in a referral for biopsy.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="43838" xml_f="44155" txt_i="27613" txt_f="27930">In addition, our study was uniquely implemented at a VA hospital, an equal-access setting with a range of preventive and treatment services.

First, as previously described, in response to repetition between the roles of our initial nurse practitioner navigator and clinic-based nurses, we adapted our model to include a social worker and lay health navigator who worked closely with the VA nurses to facilitate clinical needs. Programs planning navigation team composition should consider utilizing existing providers with the requisite knowledge. This approach supports a smooth clinical research transition and facilitates timely study initiation. Second, our project was originally designed to prospectively enroll navigated and control participants at two demographically similar VA outpatient clinics. Due to a hospital merger prior to accrual, we adapted our design to include a concurrent records-based control group drawn from the same VA clinic as the navigated patients. Future navigation studies should similarly be prepared to adapt quickly to unanticipated clinic site changes. Finally, since our navigators lacked access to the VA appointment scheduling system, they focused on patient adherence to scheduled visits to prevent delayed follow-up. Thus, intervention approaches that similarly comprise proactive measures—envisioning and actuating issues that could introduce delay—rather than reactively resolving patient-identified barriers can be invaluable in reaching targeted navigation goals.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title><offsets xml_i="47853" xml_f="47863" txt_i="31223" txt_f="31233">Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47874" xml_f="48832" txt_i="31234" txt_f="32192">Racial/ethnic disparities in prostate cancer outcomes have been well documented, and patient navigation represents one strategy that has proven effective in improving timeliness of diagnostic resolution in community health centers and breast cancer settings. The goal of our patient navigation study was not to alter prostate cancer screening practices at the VA hospital; rather, we sought to work within the existing systems framework to provide a more patient-centered and disease-specific approach to ensuring patient adherence with prostate cancer care. We focused on navigating low-income individuals within the VA with an abnormal finding consistent with prostate cancer, which arguably might not address the potential navigational needs of similarly situated men outside the VA system. Further research that utilizes novel methodologies and is directed at examining navigation interventions for men with prostate cancer who lack VA support is needed.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="48854" xml_f="48873" txt_i="32194" txt_f="32213">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48884" xml_f="48942" txt_i="32214" txt_f="32272">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="48964" xml_f="48986" txt_i="32274" txt_f="32296">Authors’ contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="48997" xml_f="49541" txt_i="32297" txt_f="32841">MS, JM, NN, and PB contributed to the needs assessment, design of the study, and development of the research protocol.
