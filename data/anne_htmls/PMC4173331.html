The thoughts of pain create a lot of unknown fears, anxiety and stress in the minds of such patients despite administration of adequate premedication. Even the post-op period can acquire the dimensions of a nightmare once a patient starts experiencing the agony of excruciating pain if not given proper attention. Epidural anesthesia and analgesia is widely regarded as a boon for such patients as it can provide a relief from pain for a longer duration and the facility of further top-ups and continuous infusion of the analgesic drugs through epidural catheter thus provides an uneventful and smooth recovery. Epidural bupivacaine had been used extensively in the past for providing adequate post-op pain relief in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgeries. However, in recent years, ropivacaine has increasingly replaced bupivacaine for the said purpose because of its similar analgesic properties, lesser motor blockade and decreased propensity of cardiotoxicity.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1"><offsets xml_i="6860" xml_f="6861" txt_i="2894" txt_f="2895">1</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="6868" xml_f="7168" txt_i="2895" txt_f="3195">] Though a slightly larger dose of ropivacaine is required as compared to bupivacaine to achieve the analgesic and anesthetic effects, the addition of an adjuvant can decrease the dose of ropivacaine required, thereby eliminating quite a few side effects associated with larger doses of ropivacaine.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2"><offsets xml_i="7201" xml_f="7202" txt_i="3195" txt_f="3196">2</offsets></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3"><offsets xml_i="7242" xml_f="7243" txt_i="3196" txt_f="3197">3</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7250" xml_f="7251" txt_i="3197" txt_f="3198">]</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7258" xml_f="7503" txt_i="3199" txt_f="3444">Opioids, given by epidural route to relieve post-op pain, may provide adequate analgesia when given in low doses, but can also cause mental confusion, somnolence, nausea and vomiting, itching and respiratory depression when given in high doses.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4"><offsets xml_i="7536" xml_f="7537" txt_i="3444" txt_f="3445">4</offsets></xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5"><offsets xml_i="7577" xml_f="7578" txt_i="3445" txt_f="3446">5</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7585" xml_f="7798" txt_i="3446" txt_f="3659">] Local anesthetic and opioid combination was shown to be more effective in epidural analgesia for post-op pain as their effects started rapidly and lasted longer when compared with local anesthetics given alone.[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6"><offsets xml_i="7831" xml_f="7832" txt_i="3659" txt_f="3660">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="7839" xml_f="8214" txt_i="3660" txt_f="4035">] Epidural fentanyl has been widely used in neuraxial blockades as a better alternative to morphine as far as opioid-induced complications and side effects are concerned.

However, when it is used alone, analgesia will not be enough and overdosing is needed, and side effects like itching, nausea, vomiting and urinary retention are observed.
