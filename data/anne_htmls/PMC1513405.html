As an addition to the main trial results, the researchers also wanted to find out how the different treatment regimens affected the ability of the malaria parasite to generate sexual forms (gametocytes) in the participants' blood, and to what extent the parasites are then transmitted to mosquitoes. The researchers also tested whether malaria parasites had a specific genotype, termed TYRG, comprising mutations in four distinct genes associated with resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and whether that affected transmission of the parasites back to mosquitoes.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9110" xml_f="9111" txt_i="3074" txt_f="3075">

However, this does not explain why the significant numbers of CQ-resistant parasites were not also less infectious at day 7 in the CQ treatment group, because their early development is expected to be unimpaired by drug. An alternative hypothesis is that SP treatment in some way perturbs the gametocyte sex ratio, so that the accumulation of one sex is delayed, thus preventing fertilization until sufficient of both sexes are present in the gametocyte population.

TYRG carrying parasites thus appear to enjoy a substantial survival advantage, which leads to favourable transmission under CQ/SP treatment. In contrast, TYRG genotypes were less successfully transmitted than other genotypes in both monotherapy arms; in the CQ treatment group, this difference was statistically significant. This supports the view that drug-resistant parasites are likely to be less fit, relative to other genotypes in the population, in the absence of the particular drug or combination of drugs that has led to their selection [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010015-b020" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="46946" xml_f="46948" txt_i="32566" txt_f="32568">20</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46955" xml_f="46957" txt_i="32568" txt_f="32570">].</offsets></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title><offsets xml_i="46988" xml_f="47004" txt_i="32572" txt_f="32588">Generalizability</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="47015" xml_f="47158" txt_i="32589" txt_f="32732">Our data did not provide clear evidence of within-host selection for the TYRG genotype, as we have previously observed in CQ-treated patients [</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010015-b012" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="47204" xml_f="47206" txt_i="32732" txt_f="32734">12</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47213" xml_f="47214" txt_i="32734" txt_f="32735">,</offsets><xref rid="pctr-0010015-b013" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="47260" xml_f="47262" txt_i="32735" txt_f="32737">13</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="47269" xml_f="47344" txt_i="32737" txt_f="32812">].
