We conducted a randomized sham-controlled trial of moxibustion. Sixteen patients with metastatic cancer were recruited from Daejeon, South Korea. The patients were randomly placed into a true or a sham moxibustion group and received 10 true or sham moxibustion treatments administered to the abdomen (CV12, CV8, CV4) and legs (ST36) over a 2-week period. Outcome measures included interest in participating in the trial, identification of successful recruitment strategies, the appropriateness of eligibility criteria, and compliance with the treatment plan (ie, attendance at treatment sessions). Clinical outcomes included results of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT), answers on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item core quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaires, scores on the visual analogue scale (VAS), and the results from blood tests and a safety evaluation. </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="6435" xml_f="6442" txt_i="1158" txt_f="1165">Results</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="6451" xml_f="6793" txt_i="1165" txt_f="1507">. Moxibustion was an acceptable intervention in patients with metastatic cancer. Compliance with the treatment protocol was high, with 11 patients completing all 10 treatments. No serious adverse events related to moxibustion occurred, but 4 patients in the true moxibustion group reported mild rubefaction, which disappeared in a few hours. </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="6801" xml_f="6811" txt_i="1507" txt_f="1517">Conclusion</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="6820" xml_f="7019" txt_i="1517" txt_f="1716">.

Two moxibustion devices were burned at each point for about 40 minutes; that is, after 1 moxibustion had been burned for about 20 minutes, another moxibustion was burned for another 20 minutes. Moxibustion was administered by Korean medicine doctors who had 2 or more years of clinical experience practicing moxibustion therapy. During each treatment, the procedure was carefully monitored by practitioners to prevent any adverse events related to moxibustion, and all vital signs and any changes in medical history were determined at each visit.

It covers the areas of physical well-being (7 items), social/family well-being (7 items), emotional well-being (6 items), and functional well-being (7 items). In addition to the FACT-G items, the FAACT has 12 additional items under the anorexia/cachexia subscale (ACS) category. All FAACT items are scored from 0 = “not at all” to 4 = “very much,” so the total score ranges from 0 to 156. Higher scores imply a better state of the patient.

All of the scales and the single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high score on a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of function, and a high score for global health status/quality of life represents a high quality of life, but a high score on the symptom scale represents a high level of symptomatology.

the patients who participated in this study. Most patients stated that moxibustion might have helped improve their anorexia to some degree while other answered that they were uncertain of its effect. During the study period, some patients felt uncomfortable due to the moxa smoke, and some patients complained of redness of the skin although that disappeared in a few hours. Some patients complained about the uncomfortable posture during treatment because lying on their backs for 40 minutes without movement caused back pain and muscle tension. Another thing that bothered the patients was the tight schedule. In this study, patients were required to visit the hospital 5 times a week for 2 weeks (total 10 times) because of the short study period. We were concerned that the patients might tire of the treatment or have trouble meeting the treatment schedule, and actually, 1 patient did drop out due to commuting difficulties.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="38353" xml_f="39009" txt_i="19502" txt_f="20158">Preliminary data from this study indicated that moxibustion was potentially effective for treating anorexia and improving quality of life in patients with metastatic cancer. After 10 sessions of treatment, the patients in the true moxibustion group showed lesser degrees of anorexia and appetite loss on the anorexia-cachexia subscale of the FAACT questionnaire and on the EORTC QLQ questionnaire, respectively.

However, recruitment of patients was not successful (only 16 were recruited vs the original goal of 20), which might have been caused by the lack of recruitment strategies, including social and multimedia approaches. When planning a future study of moxibustion for treating anorexia in patients with cancer, various recruitment methods, such as newspaper advertising, referrals from health professionals, contact with patient community groups, and so on, should be used.

Based on patient input, we found that the treatment schedule (5 times a week for 2 weeks) was too tight and was a contributing factor in the dropout rate. We also found that the long treatment time (40 minutes per session) imposed a heavy strain on the patients’ body, especially patients who had thin body shapes or chest/abdominal discomfort. When planning a future study of moxibustion for the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer, the treatment time should be less than 40 minutes if possible, and a less restrictive schedule of treatments should be considered. Additionally this study was a feasibility study and lacked follow-up. Future trials to investigate the efficacy of moxibustion for treating anorexia and improving quality of life in patient with metastatic cancer should include follow-up.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="41647" xml_f="42930" txt_i="22624" txt_f="23907">Although moxibustion was acceptable to the patients who participated in this study, 5 patients dropped out. We think that was due to the short recruitment and treatment schedules. Also, when we recruited and enrolled patients at the baseline, our exclusion criteria did not include personal reasons, such as (busy schedule, commuting time, personal problems, unstable and moody personalities, etc) or health problems necessitating simultaneous treatments at other hospitals. We included any patient with cancer-related symptoms such as mild fatigue, ennui, indigestion, and so on. During the study, 2 patients stopped treatment reportedly for reasons of poor physical condition (not feeling good today). This “not feeling good today” might have 2 origins: Patients with cancer-related symptoms might feel too tired when trying to keep the tight treatment schedule and might be influenced by mood swings. A further analysis of the dropout rate found that patients who dropped out had personal reasons or other scheduled hospital treatment schedule, not that they felt uncomfortable or dissatisfied with the moxibustion treatment. Unfortunately, the high dropout rate occurred in the true moxibustion group. Thus, future studies should consider these factors during the planning stage.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="42937" xml_f="43043" txt_i="23908" txt_f="24014">Evidence from sham-controlled trials of moxibustion for treating the symptoms of cancer is very important.</offsets><sup><xref rid="bibr19-1534735416654762" ref-type="bibr"><offsets xml_i="43100" xml_f="43102" txt_i="24014" txt_f="24016">19</offsets></xref></sup><offsets xml_i="43115" xml_f="43351" txt_i="24016" txt_f="24252"> Sham moxibustion devices can be divided into 2 categories: those for treatment at non-acupuncture points and those for preventing heat stimulation of acupuncture points, each having its pros and cons.
