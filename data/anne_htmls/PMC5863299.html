Conclusion</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="38463" xml_f="39645" txt_i="28313" txt_f="29495">Danhong applied as an injection is not appropriate for long-term use mainly due to the following: First, as an injection for intravenous infusion, the administration of Danhong is inconvenient for long-term use. Second, Danhong injection promotes blood circulation and is a collateral analgesic, which is only suitable for short-term use during the acute phase; long-term use will increase qi, which is not appropriate. ACS within 1 week is considered the acute phase, so Danhong injection should be used during this period. However, in the clinical setting Danhong injection is practical when combined with Naoxintong capsule. This conforms to the principle of Chinese medicine: to treat acute conditions symptomatically and chronic conditions radically. From the present study, we conclude that the combined application of Danhong injection and Naoxintong capsule can benefit ACS patients after PCI, compared with Western medications alone, by improving endothelial function. Furthermore, the treatment did not cause any detectable adverse reactions. Therefore, Danhong injection combined with Naoxintong capsule for treatment of ACS patients undergoing PCI is safe and effective.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Step Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., provided research funds to support this trial.</p></ack><sec><title>Disclosure</title><p>Step Pharmaceutical did not participate in the pilot design, test development, data analysis, or manuscript writing.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>All authors declared that there were no conflicts of interest involved.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Braunwald</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Antman</surname><given-names>E.
