Analysis of the qualitative data was done manually. All focus group discussions' (FGD) notes and tap records were translated from Afan Oromo (local language) to English. The translated texts were read by the investigators several times and mutually exclusive and meaningful categories/themes were developed. The data were then coded according to the category system. Data belonging to each category were retrieved, assembled and viewed to get meaningful interpretation based on the objectives of the study. The interpreted qualitative data were presented together with the quantitative results to triangulate the findings.

This may imply that the training has also brought change in prioritizing vulnerable groups. Nonetheless, one should realize that such priority might come because of distribution of multiple LLITN per household.

The underlying assumption in such initiatives is that providing information about the risks associated with malaria and the benefits of LLITN will lead to higher perceived value of LLITN and thus increased use of LLITN.

The effect of the intervention was more visible among under-five children. Adoption of similar LITTN use mobilization strategies is recommended in high risks areas, such as water development projects. Integrating such skill-based training in the existing health care setting would make it sustainable. Further research is suggested to evaluate the long-term impact of the intervention and its cost-effectives.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44293" xml_f="44312" txt_i="26665" txt_f="26684">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44323" xml_f="44381" txt_i="26685" txt_f="26743">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="44403" xml_f="44425" txt_i="26745" txt_f="26767">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="44436" xml_f="45022" txt_i="26768" txt_f="27354">AD conceived the study and was involved in the design, coordination, field supervision, analysis and drafted the manuscript.
