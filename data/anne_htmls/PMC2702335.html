The clinical importance of some outcomes, such as death, is usually fairly clear. However, the clinical importance of differences found in patient-reported continuous outcomes, used to assess chronic disorders with variable courses, such as low back pain, is often less clear. With ever-larger trials, and meta-analyses of data from multiple trials, we have the statistical power to demonstrate quite small mean differences in these outcome measures that are unlikely to have arisen by chance. However, the interpretation of clinical importance remains problematic. Summary statistics are, through statistical inference, applicable to a population but results from these studies may be less useful if we want to apply them to an individual. For example, a 5 mm Hg change in blood pressure may be important at a population level but of little relevance to an individual.

This could represent a situation in which the intervention has no effect in 75% of participants, whilst 25% improve by 1.0 unit, implying that on average one in every four participants treated would gain a clinically important change; the number needed to treat (NNT) is four. When only the mean difference is presented, which is half the magnitude of the MIC for an individual, the intervention is likely to be interpreted as ineffective. In contrast, an NNT of four suggests a highly effective treatment.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="9494" xml_f="9587" txt_i="5446" txt_f="5539">How outcomes are presented, can have a substantial effect on the interpretation of results.

Furthermore, for many common disorders, such as back pain, depression, chronic fatigue, etc, it may be just as important to prevent deteriorations as it is to promote improvement; but few authors who report NNT consider this. We aimed to explore practical challenges of using the NNT to report a patient-reported continuous outcome in a way that is clear to end-users and to explore its implications on the interpretation of a previously reported trial.

Figure one shows the distributions of RMDQ score decrease in patients who were classified as having deteriorated, remaining stable, or having improved on the transition question. One can see that patients who deteriorated (those who reported being 'much worse' or 'vastly worse') have a score change distribution with a mean close to zero (0.4). The MIC cut-off of 4.0 points and the consensus threshold of 5.0 points well separate improved patients from stable patients, in these data. Further research and debate on the MIC cut-off for deterioration is needed.</offsets></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2288-9-35-1"></graphic></fig><p><offsets xml_i="25836" xml_f="25927" txt_i="18686" txt_f="18777">Pearson's correlation coefficient between the baseline and follow-up RMDQ scores was 0.52 (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="25935" xml_f="25937" txt_i="18777" txt_f="18779">P </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="25946" xml_f="25984" txt_i="18779" txt_f="18814">&lt; 0.001) at three months and 0.50 (</offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="25992" xml_f="25994" txt_i="18814" txt_f="18816">P </offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="26003" xml_f="26115" txt_i="18816" txt_f="18925">&lt; 0.001) at one year.
