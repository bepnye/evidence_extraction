Patient education has been found to be one of the most fundamental and essential care programs on the basis of identification and control of the patients' health criteria. The study is a quasi-experimental research consisting of two groups. In this study, 112 patients with myocardial infarction who were below the age of 70 were selected randomly and divided into two groups (case group and control group) after being matched based on age and sex. The researcher first measured the health indexes including smoking, cholesterol level, body mass, level of anxiety, and amount of systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients who have been diagnosed with myocardial infarction for the first time. He performed education program in case group and analyzed the said variables after four months. He also compared the behaviors in the two groups after being educated. The data was analyzed by SPSS software, version 15 (This product is licensed to FeFDBi, ABiComputer, 1337), and the two groups were compared by using appropriate statistical tests.

Data concerning cholesterol level was extracted from the patients' case, and the questions regarding smoking and demographic data were directly asked and recorded in questionnaire. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight, and height were measured by the researcher via a measurement tool. The second questionnaire contained 21 test questions each having four choices, with a point range from 0 to 3 and the maximum point was 63. Based on the points obtained, the patients were placed in one of these four groups: without anxiety (below 10 points), low anxiety (10–18 points), average anxiety (19–29 points), and high anxiety (30–63 points).
