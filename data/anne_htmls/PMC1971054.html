Why Psychiatrists were so reluctant to be interviewed was not clear, other than the messages relayed from secretaries back to the research team about them being "too busy" or "not interested in the study".

For the CMHT respondents and Psychiatrists, whose specific role in the team is unclear, the term "severe mental illness" is used with two contrasting meanings. Firstly as a strict medical category serving the function of an effective gate-criterion for prioritising referral access to the team, but secondly as a descriptive term used to guide clinical practice and informed by the teams' broader perception of what constitutes severe and enduring mental health problems (as described by King [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15"><offsets xml_i="36239" xml_f="36241" txt_i="29744" txt_f="29746">15</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="36248" xml_f="37631" txt_i="29746" txt_f="31129">]). This highlights the tension which exists between the service delivery requirement of having to meet a perceived large demand with limited team resources, and fulfil the clinical responsibilities of managing people with complex needs. This tension is echoed in the GP narratives, where there is also confusion over the role and function of the team. GPs wanted a quick response to requests for assessments of patients in crisis, but also the provision of on-going management for a selected few patients. The GPs that we interviewed in this study described confusion over thresholds for referral of a patient and for acceptance of that referral by the team. They reported that they were unable to challenge the criteria because they perceived they were not explicit. CMHT leads, meanwhile, talked about having clearly defined referral criteria (patients with "severe and enduring mental health problems") but their flexible interpretation of these criteria provided, for them, the possibility of having some level of control over their workload. This flexibility of interpretation operated, we observed, as a demand management technique. However, we must also add that this ad-hoc operational flexibility and lack of clarity in decision-making is inconsistent with the trend towards improved clinical governance in CMHTs, which emphasises consistency and transparency of response [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"><offsets xml_i="37663" xml_f="37665" txt_i="31129" txt_f="31131">21</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37672" xml_f="37674" txt_i="31131" txt_f="31133">].</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="37681" xml_f="37905" txt_i="31134" txt_f="31358">Other commentators suggest that a strong adherence to uni-professional values and the absence of a shared philosophy within CMHTs, as well as a mistrust of managerial solutions to the problems of inter-professional working [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"><offsets xml_i="37937" xml_f="37939" txt_i="31358" txt_f="31360">22</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="37946" xml_f="38301" txt_i="31360" txt_f="31715">] all contributed to limiting the effective function of a CMHT.

They also expressed strong opinions on what GPs should do before making a referral. Yet inconsistency was evident, as some stated that GPs should do an "assessment", and others expressed no confidence in GPs being able to assess the patient as they would wish (assessment of risk and including the use of the TAG). CMHTs members seemed preoccupied by their own perceived lack of capacity (amounting to role strain), roles and responsibilities (perhaps due to the difficulties described above) rather than considering fully either the nature of the primary care request, or the needs of the referred patient.
