Following intention-to-treat principles, complicated cases should be included to obtain an objective impression of absolute costs. Using means results in a biased impression of falsely increased measures as a consequence of skewed data, while using medians would ignore complicated cases since in cholecystectomy about 80% of operations are uneventful procedures (Table </offsets><xref ref-type="table" rid="T4"><offsets xml_i="46279" xml_f="46280" txt_i="25181" txt_f="25182">4</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="46287" xml_f="47007" txt_i="25182" txt_f="25902">). In our trial one extreme outlier occurred. Differences in techniques have to be distinguished from random variations. Meta-analyses demonstrate no differences in complications between laparoscopic and small-incision cholecystectomy. We therefore believe that differences in complication costs should be considered random variations. Moreover, our trial was not powered to detect differences in complication costs and these results should be considered a spurious finding and should therefore not be statistically tested at all. Reporting costs excluding one outlier in each group might therefore be more correct as it incorporates complication costs but prohibits distortion of total costs by random extreme outliers.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="47014" xml_f="47549" txt_i="25903" txt_f="26438">There are several problems in analyzing and pooling cost results from different studies.

Possibilities for future savings by reduction of hospital stay (direct costs), irrespective of the operating technique for cholecystectomy, were compared to savings by reduction of sick leave (indirect costs). Assuming 21000 cholecystectomies in the Netherlands, reducing hospital stay by one night (50%) in every patient would result in potential savings of 4.8 million euro in the Netherlands annually.
