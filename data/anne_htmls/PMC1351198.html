(Doorwerth, The Netherlands) introduced a commercially available innovative product and concept to promote physical activity. This concept consists of a physical activity monitor (PAM) as well as a specially designed website (PAM COACH) which gives personalized physical activity advice, based on the amount of physical activity measured by the physical activity monitor. After consultation with PAM B.V. (dr. E.P.N. Damen), the VU University Medical Centre (VUmc) and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment decided to evaluate this concept by scientific research. An application for funding was made and granted by The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw), a non-profit organization. In order to conduct the PAM project, PAM B.V. sold the required PAMs to VUmc and facilitated access to the PAM COACH website, and provided us with technical PAM support. PAM B.V. was not a partner in the research proposal and in the further execution and processing of the study. The PAM project started in 2003 and will end mid-2006.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="6670" xml_f="6725" txt_i="2720" txt_f="2775">Arguments for publishing the design of a study protocol</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="6736" xml_f="7376" txt_i="2776" txt_f="3416">This article describes the design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT).

The PAM can be attached easily to a belt and is worn on the right hip. The PAM produces a cumulative score, which is a proxy measure of total daily (24 h) physical activity. The PAM score is displayed continuously on the PAM. Via a docking station, which must be connected to a computer with an Internet connection, the user can upload his personal PAM scores through PAM software to the COACH database any time of the day. The COACH database is part of the COACH website. At first login on the COACH website, the users register themselves by filling out a form with personal data (i.e. height, weight) and a onetime brief questionnaire with 10 yes-no questions (e.g. Do you think you are able to walk to your work when it is raining?). Entering the COACH website, the user is asked to formulate an activity goal along with the COACH, based on the users' PAM score and age. On every subsequent login the COACH website presents all the collected PAM scores in orderly graphs per day which is supported by practical information on user preferred activities (e.g. daily an extra 60 minutes walking, or 25 minutes running, or 20 minutes playing squash). In addition, the user receives on subsequent logins tailored feedback on determinants of physical activity based on the answers of the onetime questionnaire at registration. Next to the feedback on the COACH website, the users can easily monitor their progress in daily physical activity by reading their score on the display of the PAM itself. Users can thus compare their progress with their set personal activity goal. Furthermore some features are changed with the cooperation of Pam B.V at the original COACH website in aid of the intervention. Unlike the original COACH website, the intervention COACH website will neither formulate a weight goal, nor give nutritional advice. Furthermore, general practical advices to implement physical activity in daily life are added to the site.
