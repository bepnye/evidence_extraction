A randomized trial showed that acupuncture was effective in controlling pain after abdominal surgery, but the efficacy of this technique for the treatment of thoracotomy pain has not been established.

The procedure is extensive and can be associated with severe pain in patients already compromised by numerous other co-morbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pain that limits respiratory function can have devastating consequences on post-operative recovery; consequently, extensive measures such as epidural catheters, local anesthetic infiltration and nonsteroidal-anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are used to maximize analgesia and minimize side effects.

Acupuncture represents a modality providing analgesia with a paucity of side effects; however, acupuncture needles can potentially overlap with the surgical field and also hamper epidural catheter placement, making acupuncture impractical. We undertook a single-arm, open-label, clinical trial to assess: 1) the feasibility of employing pre-operative acupuncture needles near the operative field for analgesia after thoracotomy, 2) the acceptance by patient's of a non-traditional technique after receiving a diagnosis as ominous as cancer, 3) the percentage of patients providing evaluable pain data at the first post-operative visit (approximately 30 days post surgery), 4) the occurrence of any adverse effects, 5) to determine the optimal primary outcome and timepoint for the randomized trial, 6) to provide data to determine sample size calculations. With respect to the primary aim, the trial was considered "feasible" if at least 75% of patients tolerated the intervention; if the intervention did not interfere with surgery and routine post-operative care; if at least 75% of patients provided evaluable data at the first post-operative visit; and, if reported adverse events were acceptable. Furthermore, accrual needed to be sufficiently rapid so that, after appropriate sample size calculations, a randomized trial could be completed in less than two years.</offsets></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title><offsets xml_i="7874" xml_f="7881" txt_i="3941" txt_f="3948">Methods</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="7892" xml_f="8161" txt_i="3949" txt_f="4218">The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in accordance with an assurance filed with and approved by the Department of Health and Human Services.

Hydromorphone or morphine were chosen for the epidural instead of fentanyl if an adverse reaction precluded the use of the latter. Of the evaluable patients, ten were initiated on fentanyl and fifteen patients on hydromorphone. In addition analgesia was supplemented with intravenous narcotics as needed. Unless contraindicated, all patients received ketorolac 15–30 mg intravenously prior to closure and in the post-operative period as needed for up to 3 days. If a patient had persistent side effects with subjective complaints of unacceptable analgesia, the epidural opioid was changed to either hydromorphone or morphine or removed entirely; nine patients received more than one drug.

Patients were given oral medications (typically oxycodone with acetaminophen) as needed to manage any ongoing pain. All needles were replaced after the epidural catheter was removed, typically 24 to 48 hours before discharge from the hospital. No restrictions were placed on patients' activity level or showering. Patients were asked to remove the leg and auricular needles a week after discharge. Needles on the back were removed by an acupuncturist at the first follow-up visit, usually 3 to 4 weeks postoperatively. Patients who remained in pain at this time were offered further acupuncture treatment consisting of stainless steel, 15 mm × 0.16 mm Seirin auricular needles placed bilaterally for 20–25 minutes at the "Shenmen", "brain" and "adrenal" points in the ear. In addition, up to two needles were placed at auricular points corresponding to the sites where patients were experiencing most pain (e.g. chest, abdomen or ribs). Brief manual stimulation was used immediately after insertion. Practitioners attempted to achieve "de qi", but this was assessed by needle sensation rather than questioning of the patient. Following this treatment, acupressure metal balls were applied at the same points, and patients were taught to press each point for two minutes twice a day. They were also instructed to press on the points if they experienced exacerbation of pain. The metal balls typically remained in place for 4–7 days. These were used in preference to intradermal needles for this stage of treatment, when there is no further contact with an acupuncturist, as they do not penetrate the skin and there is no risk of infection were the patient to forget to remove them.</offsets></p></sec></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="14079" xml_f="14106" txt_i="9794" txt_f="9821">Acupuncture quality control</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="14117" xml_f="14704" txt_i="9822" txt_f="10409">Immediately after each needle insertion, acupuncturists completed an audit sheet verifying the acupuncture points used.

We assumed a minimum, clinically significant difference of 25%, i.e., that BPI scores will be 25% lower in the acupuncture group compared to placebo.
