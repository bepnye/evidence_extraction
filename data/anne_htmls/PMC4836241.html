Compared with the pretherapeutic level, no statistical change took place in the liver and renal functions, and lipid profile in all the three groups after the treatment. However, the levels of E2, FSH, and LH as well as endometrial thickness decreased significantly after therapy, which was mainly due to the effective inhibition of pituitary gonadotropin secretion by GnRH-a, reducing ovarian secretion of sex hormone drastically. By comparison with Tibolone group, the post-therapeutic E2 levels in Kuntai and Control groups were significantly lower, while FSH and LH levels were higher. These results revealed that, short-term use of Kuntai capsule or Tibolone had no obvious influence on patients’ liver and renal functions, as well as serum lipid metabolism, and Kuntai capsule had no obvious estrogenic effects. In terms of adverse reactions, certain superiority and advantages were reflected in Kuntai group. The incidence of vaginal bleeding or spotting, and breast distending pain in Kuntai group were significantly lower than that in Tibolone.

Although the clear clinical effect of Kuntai capsule might appear a little later than Tibolone tablet, maybe this indicates that Kuntai capsule should be administrated much earlier, even before the GnRH-a injection for EMS patients. Kuntai capsule had no obvious impact on patients’ liver and renal functions as well as blood lipid metabolism. It might be a safe and effective treatment option especially for the patients with hormone contraindications. Both Kuntai capsule and Tibolone could be successfully applied to the “add-back therapy” for GnRH-a injection in EMS patients, and Kuntai capsule might be a little safer as it had a lower incidence of adverse events.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="36226" xml_f="36573" txt_i="25891" txt_f="26238">However, this study was based on 75 subjects from two hospitals.
