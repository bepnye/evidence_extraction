During the period of initial titration, a regular dosing schedule of three times a day has two significant problems: breakthrough pain (BTP) caused by end-of-dose failure or predictable incidental BTP that in turn causes sleep disturbances at night or dawn and considerable adverse events such as dizziness, somnolence, and ataxia during the daytime.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="6242" xml_f="6709" txt_i="1915" txt_f="2382">There are significant differences between ambulatory outpatients and immobile inpatients in how gabapentin is administrated during the titration period. Immobile inpatients with neuropathic pain combined with or without somatic or visceral pain do not generally experience motion-related adverse events such as dizziness, nausea, and ataxia.

This is increased by 400 mg/day from days 4 to 6 up to 1,200 mg/day to maximize efficacy and delivered three times a day (TID). After 1 week of treatment, the dose is titrated up to 1,800 mg/day. However, many ambulatory neuropathic patients have experienced common adverse events during the day and sleep deprivation from night pain. All intractable pain should be controlled from sleep deprivation due to night pain to pain during activity. The initiation dose and fast titration of gabapentin might be limited by intolerable side effects during day time in an ambulatory patient.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="7476" xml_f="7839" txt_i="3137" txt_f="3500">In present study, gabapentin was initiated and titrated at the same total daily dose as the standard schedule, but it was administered in unequal four times a day (QID).

The patients recorded their persistent pain in a daily dairy by using an 11-point scale with 0 as "no pain" and 10 as "worst imaginable pain". The period prevalence, intensity, and duration were recorded if BTP occurred. Sleep disturbance due to pain was divided into 3 phases of sleep: induction, maintenance, and emergence.

There is a difference between the strict 8 h dosing and the less restrictive TID. According to dietary schedule and sleeping time, it is difficult for patients with neuropathic pain to strictly take gabapentin every 8 h. After ingestion of drugs including gabapentin in the evening around 7 to 8 o'clock following dinner, the next medication is usually taken in the morning around 7 to 8 o'clock following breakfast, according to the TID regimen. The drug administration interval is therefore approximately 12 h. Even if the last medication is delayed until just before sleep, the administration interval becomes at least 7 to 8 h. However, it is not easy to keep taking medication three or four times in a day. If patients feel little pain in the evening, it is easy to forget to take medication at night before sleep.

The first goal, to remove pain at night, is usually interrupted by BTP rather than by persistent pain during the titration period. While there is no clear consensus regarding its definition, a common working definition for BTP is an abrupt, short lived and intense pain that can "breakthrough" the around-the-clock analgesia that controls persistent pain [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><offsets xml_i="17044" xml_f="17045" txt_i="11979" txt_f="11980">6</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17052" xml_f="17710" txt_i="11980" txt_f="12638">]. On the basis of the information obtained from medical histories and physical examinations, the BTP experienced by most patients can be categorized as one of three subtypes: incidental; idiopathic or spontaneous; and end-of-dose. The incidental or spontaneous subtype is the most common, accounting for about half of BTP episodes. Incidental BTP can be further divided into two categories: predictable and unpredictable. Predictable BTP is directly related to musculoskeletal movements, such as coughing or turning over in bed, and unpredictable BTP is the result of contractions or spasms of visceral smooth muscles, such as with bowel or bladder spasms [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><offsets xml_i="17741" xml_f="17742" txt_i="12638" txt_f="12639">7</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="17749" xml_f="19163" txt_i="12639" txt_f="14053">]. The prevalence of neuropathic BTP is more common in the initial titration phase than in the maintenance phase of gabapentin administration because of predictable incidental BTP episodes or end-of-dose failure. Metastatic cancer pain has all 3 types of BTP etiology, including somatic, visceral, and/or neuropathic origin. In this study, it was difficult to recognize and differentiate the 3 types of BTP characteristics because the participants were outpatients. However, it was possible for patients to record the prevalence of sleep disturbance due to night pain by the classification of BTP during the following sleep phases: induction, maintenance, and emergence. Even though there was no difference in the prevalence, intensity, and duration of BTP between the 2 groups, the number of patients who experienced emergence from sleep due to pain much larger than the number of patients who experienced sleep induction or difficulty in sleep maintenance in this study. This means that during the initiation and titration period, it is important to control BTP, an abrupt, short lived and intense pain, rather than persistent pain, which is more problematic in the maintenance period. Majority of patients in both groups, from 64.7 to 96.3%, who experienced persistent pain, also complained of BTP. It seems that it is difficult to provide patients who experienced BTP with sufficient analgesia from gabapentin.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19170" xml_f="19434" txt_i="14054" txt_f="14318">High doses of gabapentin may be tolerable because most of the drug is excreted unabsorbed.

When comparing these two different schedules that have the same total administration dose of gabapentin during the initiation and titration period from the view point of therapeutic and adverse effects, administration in an unequally divided QID manner had some merits with lower pain scores from study day 3 to 10 and fewer adverse effects in ambulatory patients during the study
