The long exposure of UV light inactivates microorganisms by damaging the DNA and disrupting the chemical bonds that hold the atoms of DNA together in the microorganism. If the damage is severe enough, the bacteria cannot repair the damage and are inactivated. However, despite long exposure, a previous literature review[</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31"><offsets xml_i="25294" xml_f="25296" txt_i="17855" txt_f="17857">31</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="25303" xml_f="25773" txt_i="17857" txt_f="18327">] has questioned the potential of low-intensity UV radiation in microbial deactivation, and the authors concluded that low-intensity UV rays are not effective against certain microbes and molds. Furthermore, tightly packed bristles and other areas are not in direct exposure and have no chance of disinfection.
