Given the significance of oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscular damage related with high-intensity exercise, it would be interesting to evaluate the influence of oral supplementation with an antioxidant substance able of diminishing muscular damage, free radicals production, and inflammatory signaling associated with this performance.
