The results also suggest that treatment satisfaction may also be related to compliance, since patients who were more satisfied remained in the trial for a longer time. A single-item measure of patient satisfaction was sensitive to clinical improvement and adherence. Patient-reported outcomes, such as satisfaction with medications, offer a way of measuring both efficacy and tolerability features of treatments from a patient perspective. As rated by the MSQ, data suggest that the significantly greater patient satisfaction with risperidone than quetiapine or placebo may be related to the greater symptom reduction associated with risperidone. This is suggested by both regression models in which a reduction in psychotic symptoms consistently emerged as a significant predictor of medication satisfaction. Further, in the multiple regression model, treatment with risperidone, but not quetiapine, and increasing age were also predictive of medication satisfaction. Our finding that patient satisfaction is related to improvement of positive symptoms and not negative symptoms might be related to the duration of the trial. As was the case in this trial, within 6 weeks, positive symptoms usually decline much more than negative or other symptoms. While certain safety issues are often cited as limiting factors for patient acceptability, neither movement disorders measures nor prolactin elevation was predictive of medication satisfaction.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="25310" xml_f="25777" txt_i="14571" txt_f="15038">Future studies of second-generation antipsychotic medications should routinely include measures of medication satisfaction. Unlike the current study, in which the measure was only administered at 2 time points, consideration should be given to measuring satisfaction each time efficacy is measured. With the advent of yet improved formulations and long-acting medications designed to improve compliance, medication satisfaction will be an outcome of major importance.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="25799" xml_f="25818" txt_i="15040" txt_f="15059">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="25829" xml_f="26007" txt_i="15060" txt_f="15234">GG declares he is an employee of Janssen, the company which funded the research, manuscript development, and the journal's article processing charge.
