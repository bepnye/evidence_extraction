The resulting parameter estimates, such as the treatment effect estimate, can be interpreted as log hazard ratios. For these models, patients without restenosis were censored at the time of their last carotid duplex ultrasound. Censoring was assumed to be non-informative. The proportionality of hazards was assessed by interactions with follow-up time periods. There was some suggestion that the hazard ratio of endovascular treatment versus carotid endarterectomy for the 50% or greater restenosis outcome might decrease over the course of the study, but the test for non-proportionality of hazards was not significant (p=0·1). The hazard ratios and their 95% CIs throughout the follow-up period are reported. Life-table analyses were used to estimate the cumulative incidences of restenosis at the scheduled examination times after treatment, with predefined interest in the incidences at 1 year and 5 years. For the patients diagnosed with restenosis who were missing from the previous scheduled ultrasound examination, restenosis was assumed to have occurred during the life-table interval, half way between diagnosis and the last available normal ultrasound examination. Cumulative incidences for later than 5 years after treatment were not calculated because the patients who continued to have ultrasound follow-up was small. Multivariable generalised non-linear models that were adjusted for treatment were used to test whether 70% or more restenosis during follow-up was associated with the above defined baseline covariates and early 50–69% stenosis. Hazard ratios calculated for restenosis were adjusted for age, sex, and the independent baseline predictors of restenosis identified in the multivariable model. Cox regression analysis was used to compare time until ipsilateral cerebrovascular events between patients with and without 70% or more restenosis detected within the first year after treatment (including ultrasound examinations done up to 1·5 years after treatment because the scheduled 1-year examinations did not always take place exactly 1 year after treatment) and were adjusted for allocated treatment, age, and sex.

Owing to financial constraints and the restricted availability of ultrasound at the beginning of the trial, ultrasound follow-up was not available or was only done at 1 year after treatment at some centres. However, at the centres that recruited the most patients, annual ultrasound follow-up was usually continued after 1 year, and the median length of follow-up in CAVATAS is similar to that reported in open registries of the long-term risk of carotid restenosis. Therefore, the performance of ultrasound follow-up and its duration primarily depended on the centre where the patient was randomly assigned, rather than selection criteria at the patient level. Because equal proportions of patients were randomly assigned to each arm at the centres, any concerns about selection bias in the comparison of restenosis between treatments might be reduced. Stenting in the endovascular group was not randomly assigned in the trial, and only a few patients were treated with stents. Although the baseline characteristics were similar in those patients treated with and those treated without stents (with the exception of a history of peripheral artery disease), differences in unmeasured risk factors might have been present. Additionally, most of the patients treated with stents received them after balloon angioplasty had not reduced the degree of stenosis sufficiently. The primary carotid stenosis in these patients might therefore have differed from the stenosis in the patients in whom balloon angioplasty was successful, in a way that might have systematically altered their risk of restenosis. The strength of evidence from CAVATAS with regard to the efficacy of stenting for preventing restenosis compared with angioplasty alone is therefore limited. Without broadly accepted criteria for ultrasound of stented carotid arteries, and for reasons of consistency with previous reports from CAVATAS, the same ultrasound criteria were applied in those patients treated with and without stents. This approach might have led to the overestimation of restenosis in the patients who received stents because of reduced compliance in the vessel wall.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="39589" xml_f="40286" txt_i="32045" txt_f="32742">Our study was underpowered to detect any effect of carotid restenosis on ipsilateral stroke. Optimum medical treatment has improved since CAVATAS was designed. In particular, the use of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is likely to have increased in recent years, and antiplatelet treatment regimens to be given around the time of stenting have been developed. These factors might possibly influence the risk of restenosis after treatment, and information on lipid-lowering therapy was not systematically collected in CAVATAS. Finally, primary stenting has replaced balloon angioplasty as the endovascular treatment of choice for severe carotid stenosis.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="40293" xml_f="40978" txt_i="32743" txt_f="33428">In conclusion, restenosis is about three times more common after endovascular treatment than it is after endarterectomy and seems to cause recurrent cerebrovascular events. More data from ongoing randomised trials that compare primary carotid stenting with endarterectomy are needed to assess whether modern stenting techniques are as effective as surgery for preventing restenosis in the long term and to determine accurately the relation between restenosis and recurrent stroke over time. In particular, whether patients treated with endovascular methods require long-term follow-up with carotid duplex ultrasound to detect restenosis before it becomes symptomatic remains
