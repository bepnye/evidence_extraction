On the Total Problems score, 14.1% had a score of clinical significance while 31.3% had Internalising Problems and 23.4% with Externalising Problems. Though more females were reported with Conduct Problems than males, this difference would not be significant when corrected for the number of analyses. No other differences were observed in the frequency and severity of behavioural problems between the sexes.</offsets></p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label><offsets xml_i="24560" xml_f="24567" txt_i="15508" txt_f="15515">Table 3</offsets></label><caption><p><offsets xml_i="24587" xml_f="24643" txt_i="15515" txt_f="15571">Frequency of behavioural problems after cerebral malaria</offsets></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><offsets xml_i="24722" xml_f="24728" txt_i="15572" txt_f="15578">Domain</offsets></th><th align="center" colspan="2"><offsets xml_i="24764" xml_f="24776" txt_i="15578" txt_f="15590">Total sample</offsets><sup><offsets xml_i="24781" xml_f="24782" txt_i="15590" txt_f="15591">1</offsets></sup><break></break><offsets xml_i="24803" xml_f="24809" txt_i="15591" txt_f="15597">N = 64</offsets></th><th align="center" colspan="2"><offsets xml_i="24845" xml_f="24852" txt_i="15597" txt_f="15604">Between</offsets><break></break><offsets xml_i="24867" xml_f="24872" txt_i="15604" txt_f="15609">Sexes</offsets></th><th align="center" colspan="2"><offsets xml_i="24908" xml_f="24915" txt_i="15609" txt_f="15616">Between</offsets><break></break><offsets xml_i="24930" xml_f="24940" txt_i="15616" txt_f="15626">age groups</offsets></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="25015" xml_f="25019" txt_i="15629" txt_f="15633">Male</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="25043" xml_f="25049" txt_i="15634" txt_f="15640">Female</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="25073" xml_f="25077" txt_i="15641" txt_f="15645">6-11</offsets></td><td align="center"><offsets xml_i="25101" xml_f="25106" txt_i="15646" txt_f="15651">12-18</offsets></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><offsets xml_i="25143" xml_f="25163" txt_i="15652" txt_f="15672">CBCL syndrome scales</offsets></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="25200" xml_f="25201" txt_i="15673" txt_f="15674">N</offsets></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="25238" xml_f="25239" txt_i="15675" txt_f="15676">%</offsets></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="25276" xml_f="25277" txt_i="15677" txt_f="15678">N</offsets></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="25314" xml_f="25315" txt_i="15679" txt_f="15680">N</offsets></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="25352" xml_f="25353" txt_i="15681" txt_f="15682">N</offsets></bold></td><td align="center"><bold><offsets xml_i="25390" xml_f="25391" txt_i="15683" txt_f="15684">N</offsets></bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><offsets xml_i="25429" xml_f="25449" txt_i="15685" txt_f="15705">1.

A further limitation of our study was the limited sample size of 64 children which gave a small number of 22 for the test-retest reliability calculation. With the nine week interval between the baseline and post-intervention testing, it can be argued that important changes in behaviour can take place.
