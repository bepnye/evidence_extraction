A particularly appealing point of intervention is the sexual risk behavior associated with men’s alcohol consumption. This article reports the outcomes of The Sahwira HIV Prevention Program, a male-focused, peer-based intervention promoting the idea that men can assist their friends in avoiding high-risk sexual encounters associated with alcohol drinking. The intervention was evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) implemented in 24 beer halls in Harare, Zimbabwe. A cadre of 413 male beer hall patrons (~20% of the patronage) was trained to assist their male peers within their friendship networks. Activities included one-on-one interactions, small group discussions, and educational events centering on the theme of men helping their male friends avoid risk. Venues were randomized into 12 control versus 12 intervention beer halls with little cross-contamination between study arms. The penetration and impact of the intervention were assessed by pre- and post-intervention cross-sectional surveys of the beer hall patronage. The intervention was implemented with a high degree of fidelity to the protocol, with exposure to the intervention activities significantly higher among intervention patrons compared to control. While we found generally declining levels of risk behavior in both study arms from baseline to post-intervention, we found no evidence of an impact of the intervention on our primary outcome measure: episodes of unprotected sex with non-wife partners in the preceding 6 months (median 5.4 episodes for men at intervention beer halls vs. 5.1 among controls, </offsets><italic><offsets xml_i="5658" xml_f="5659" txt_i="1768" txt_f="1769">P</offsets></italic><offsets xml_i="5668" xml_f="5950" txt_i="1769" txt_f="2051"> = 0.98).

In Zimbabwe, beer halls are one such venue. Beer halls are a widespread communal institution in Zimbabwe where drinking alcohol is a central part of social life for many men. Beer halls are patronized overwhelmingly by men and characterized by shared drinking of inexpensive beer, working class patronage, and a loyal clientele drawn from the immediate neighborhood. With spacious indoor and outdoor seating areas, beer halls can accommodate several hundred men at a time. Their importance as sites for interventions is further enhanced because alcohol is consumed at these venues.

The spatial–temporal sampling frame was constructed such that 70% of recruitment events took place during peak patronage periods (Friday evenings, Saturdays and Sundays) and 30% during slow to moderate periods (weekday evenings). Eligibility criteria were being male, 18 years of age and older, a patron of the beer hall where recruited, sober, and being enumerated as one of every three people to cross the predetermined intercept zone at the entrance of the beer hall during the sampling period after a randomly chosen starting time. Eligible participants provided written informed consent, completed an interviewer-administered behavioral questionnaire, underwent HIV pre-test counseling, and had blood drawn for HIV testing. Informed consent, interview, blood draw, and counseling procedures took place in a mobile van parked near the beer hall entrance. Blood samples were screened for HIV antibody by HIV ½ gO enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and confirmed by a Dipstick rapid HIV assay (Pacific Biotech Co., Ltd., Bangkok, Thailand). Indeterminate results were resolved using Biotest EIA (Biotest Diagnostics Corp., Denville, NJ).

For each partner, we elicited counts of the episodes of sexual contact and condom use with each episode over the last 6 months, and whether condoms were used at the last episode of unprotected sex while intoxicated. We examined sexual risk behavior by each partner type separately, by combining all partner types, and by combining all non-wife partner types. We also classified men as having no sex with any partners in the last 6 months and married and having no other partners.

Our primary a priori hypothesis for the impact of the intervention, and the basis of our sample size and power estimation, was that the intervention could achieve a 40% lower number of episodes of unprotected sex with non-wife partners in the last 6 months among intervention beer hall patrons compared to control. Secondary outcomes included number of unprotected sexual episodes with specific partner types (including steady, casual, one off, and commercial sex partners), numbers of these different partner types, unprotected sex while intoxicated at last episode of sex with each partner type, abstaining from any sex, being faithful to one’s wife (among married men), HIV/AIDS knowledge, and testing for HIV.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="24417" xml_f="25291" txt_i="18529" txt_f="19403">Additional analyses were done to explore for further evidence of an intervention effect.

We assessed whether certain prevention activities were associated with risk reduction in the intervention arm by conducting Pearson correlations between the levels of specific activities at the beer hall and the level of reported risk behaviors. Finally, we assessed the potential effect of alcohol dependency on the intervention’s impact on risk behavior by stratifying three levels of CAGE scores (terciles of high, medium, low).

We successfully randomized drinking venues with only a small degree of cross-contamination between study arms. We developed a theory-driven, peer-led behavioral HIV prevention program and implemented it with a high degree of fidelity to the protocol, achieving good levels of intervention penetration and exposure among beer hall patrons. We measured intervention efficacy by analyzing extensive partner-by-partner sexual behavior data that allowed us to look at many permutations of sexual risk and the impact of the intervention on them. Unfortunately, we found no evidence that our intervention reduced HIV-risk related behavior among male beer hall patrons.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="64724" xml_f="66020" txt_i="40959" txt_f="42255">The primary aim of our intervention was to increase the frequency of peer-to-peer interpersonal interactions to reduce risk, such as personally intervening in a risk situation or making a plan with a peer to avert risk. The intervention achieved statistically significant, albeit modest, increases in these interactions but there was no association between these interactions and sexual risk-taking. After 15 months of targeting close circles of drinking friends to take responsibility for each other’s sexual health, we found no differences in the median numbers of sexual partners of any type, median episodes of unprotected sex with partners of any type, abstaining from sex, being faithful, percent condom use, HIV/AIDS knowledge, or HIV testing compared to patrons receiving only general prevention messages. Further, we found no convincing correlations between the reach and intensity of specific prevention efforts and risk behavior in the intervention arm. Even the more conventional peer-education activities, such as condom demonstrations, group talks, and “edu-tainment” events were not associated with behavior change even though they were well-attended. Finally, we did not find evidence of an effect of the intervention among patrons according to their levels of alcohol dependency.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="66027" xml_f="66415" txt_i="42256" txt_f="42644">Significant reductions in some measures of risk from baseline to post-intervention were noted in the intervention arm; however, this finding should not be over-interpreted. General reductions in risk were also noted in the control arm over time and one measure of risk, unprotected sex with commercial partners, was somewhat higher at baseline in the intervention arm than in the control.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="66422" xml_f="67980" txt_i="42645" txt_f="44203">It is important to examine the possible factors that contributed to the fact that this intervention did not produce the intended effects. Of course, the role of chance in the detection of effects should be considered. Had any apparent effects been evident with the conservative approach of considering the beer hall the unit of analysis, we intended more complex analyses (e.g., GEE) to account for clustering and to adjust for any residual confounding. In the end, this was not warranted. Apart from the role of chance, we identify several design and theoretical issues to consider. First, it is possible our decision to use serial, cross-sectional surveys weakened the study’s capacity for causal inference as compared to intervention studies that follow individuals over time. Our decision to use cross-sectional samples and beer halls as the unit of statistical analysis, however, was based on the nature of the intervention, which sought to effect change among beer hall patrons at large through diffusion of innovation from a core group of peer educators through their friendship networks. In order to examine the efficacy of this type of friendship network intervention, spreading outward from those directly trained by the program, we believed cross-sectional surveys were the most appropriate evaluation strategy. Of note, cohort studies are subject to some biases avoided by cross-sectional surveys, such as loss to follow-up and intervention effects from repeated contacts including multiple risk assessment surveys and HIV counseling and testing.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="67987" xml_f="70224" txt_i="44204" txt_f="46441">Second, it is possible the intervention implementation was insufficiently intense to achieve an effect. However, we implemented the intervention with high staff involvement, high levels of activity among the peer educators, multiple follow-up booster training sessions, and popularity of the intervention program among beer hall patrons. Still, given the social and economic upheaval that characterized the intervention period (mid-2005 to end of 2006) in Zimbabwe, questions remain concerning whether the intervention ever created sufficient intensity to produce measurable effects in a cross-sectional sample of beer hall patrons. For a period of 3 months, the Zimbabwean government conducted a so-called “clean up campaign” in Harare that included destruction of areas in the low-income neighborhoods where our study was conducted. We were forced to suspend the intervention activities for 2 months and to conduct intensive outreach to peer educators who had been displaced. While the majority of the trained Sahwira peer educators returned to the beer halls following the interruption, we acknowledge a period of lower intensity of the intervention. As noted in the methods, being a Sahwira peer educator did require a substantial time commitment in training, refresher courses, and facilitating activities and the voluntary nature of the program may have precluded sufficient exposure to the intervention. Of note, however, the central focus of the intervention effort was to influence the course of the usual socializing between friends at the beer halls and the visible intervention activities were meant to reinforce conversations between friends during their time together at the beer halls. Also affecting exposure to the intervention, inflation rose dramatically during the intervention period, resulting in fewer patrons attending the beer halls overall. The stress of economic decline may have also led to a decline in the salience of HIV prevention as an issue of importance among beer hall patrons. In addition, it is also possible that the men who benefited most from the intervention did not return to the beer halls as frequently and were therefore less likely to participate in the post-intervention assessment survey.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="70231" xml_f="70787" txt_i="46442" txt_f="46998">Third, our strategy for recruiting beer hall patrons to become peer educators was very inclusive, as we attempted to maximize transparency and minimize any possible tensions between cliques of drinking friends. While this strategy was successful in exceeding our recruitment expectations, it is possible that the beer hall patrons we recruited were not sufficiently influential in their social circles. Other studies have shown that when peer educators are popular opinion leaders (POLs) within their social networks, this may enhance their effectiveness [</offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27"><offsets xml_i="70820" xml_f="70822" txt_i="46998" txt_f="47000">27</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="70829" xml_f="70831" txt_i="47000" txt_f="47002">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28"><offsets xml_i="70864" xml_f="70866" txt_i="47002" txt_f="47004">28</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="70873" xml_f="70875" txt_i="47004" txt_f="47006">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30"><offsets xml_i="70908" xml_f="70910" txt_i="47006" txt_f="47008">30</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="70917" xml_f="70919" txt_i="47008" txt_f="47010">, </offsets><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44"><offsets xml_i="70952" xml_f="70954" txt_i="47010" txt_f="47012">44</offsets></xref><offsets xml_i="70961" xml_f="71040" txt_i="47012" txt_f="47091">].

In Zimbabwe, the intervention was implemented at rural centers for commerce and entertainment that included concentrations of drinking places like beer halls.

In addition, the overall trend was for lower behavioral and biological risk in both control and intervention arms, with the most dramatic declines in the Indian wine-shop venues.

Both studies suggest that male drinking venues are viable intervention sites for engaging men in male peer education programs. However, in both studies there was evidence of behavioral risk reductions in both intervention and control arms, which casts doubt on the additional effectiveness of the POL intervention over and above more conventional AIDS education approaches in these settings.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="74042" xml_f="75243" txt_i="49772" txt_f="50973">Our RCT did not produce the results we hoped to see. The publication and careful examination of interventions with negative results is an important but difficult, and often avoided, part of the process to improve prevention approaches and the methods to evaluate them. Overall, our study indicates that a male peer education intervention can be implemented in beer halls with a high degree of fidelity to theory and protocol, and that men in alcohol consumption environments are very receptive to playing an active role in such programs. Our negative findings do not mean that such peer interventions cannot work but that we have not yet found the means of harnessing male bonding in ways that significantly reduce HIV-related risk behaviors. In our view, it remains an imperative to productively engage men in AIDS prevention broadly and, more specifically, to intervene in those processes where male bonding, alcohol consumption, and sexual risk behavior are intertwined. In many parts of Africa, drinking venues deserve further exploration as intervention sites and should be just one of many community-based strategies developed to involve heterosexual men in AIDS prevention in Africa and beyond.</offsets></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a grant from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (AA13538-01).
