This has implications on every level of the care pathway. Clinicians will have a greater say in prioritising the patients, and such a system will allow for favouritism to take place. Consultants will have more say in regards to their operating lists, as the final decision will lie with them. Priority scoring systems will also fail to discern between high and low priority cases if patients wise up to the system and learn to work their way around it. Clinicians will also be more pushed into making a decision if they were more sympathetic towards patients' need. Difficult patients who harass clinicians by wanting surgery could also have an implication on the system, by demanding surgery.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="14641" xml_f="14896" txt_i="9817" txt_f="10072">As part of this study we analysed gender differences between male and female patients.

This would lower the threshold for complaint in regards to their requirement for a TKA, making it slightly more difficult for clinicians to assess the scenario objectively. The high proportion of male consultants in orthopaedics could also be another contributing factor in failure to communicate adequately. Currently, outcome measures such as the Oxford Knee Score are used in clinical practise. Prioritising patients using the Oxford Knee Score is possible, but the SPSS has an advantage from a practicality point of view. The SPSS is a much simpler and easy to use tool. It requires very little time and effort to complete, making it ideal for clinicians to use in a busy outpatient clinic environment. Prioritising patients can be done from the very first encounter by clinicians and this can be reassessed again by completing the same system when reviewing patients. Furthermore, the Oxford Knee score looks at outcome measures as well and isn't purely a prioritisation tool. The SPSS was not designed specifically for TKA, but due to its simplicity and easily understood criteria, it was utilised without too much difficulty and produced good agreement between patients and clinicians.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="16242" xml_f="16657" txt_i="11336" txt_f="11751">One limitation of the study was that the SPSS was not compared directly with another scoring system such as the Oxford Knee Score during the consultation.

The implementation of a priority scoring system should be considered in elective health care settings. A more definitive and specific questionnaire, used only for TKA surgery needs to be developed to aid in prioritising patients, rather than placing them on arbitrary waiting lists. A similar but specific system can then be further implemented in other areas with long waiting lists. The key to ensuring that such a system is easily implemented and is successful is to keep it simple and accurate. The balance between discretion by clinicians or flexibility and avoidance of fraud by any party needs to be maintained for this system to work efficiently and successfully.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17795" xml_f="17814" txt_i="12826" txt_f="12845">Competing interests</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17825" xml_f="17885" txt_i="12846" txt_f="12906">The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</offsets></p></sec><sec><title><offsets xml_i="17907" xml_f="17929" txt_i="12908" txt_f="12930">Authors' contributions</offsets></title><p><offsets xml_i="17940" xml_f="18069" txt_i="12931" txt_f="13060">All authors contributed equally to this work.
