This study was, however, based on only 45 tumor samples. In the present study, we examined 158 serum samples from lung cancer patients and 50 from healthy individuals using the SELDI technique with the WCX2 proteinchip. The classification tree was constructed to distinguish lung cancer cases from healthy individuals using 5 protein peaks at 11493, 6429, 8245, 5335 and 2538 Da as a marker pattern. When the model was tested with the blinded test set, it yielded a sensitivity of 86.9%, specificity of 80.0%, and positive predictive value of 92.4% (73/79). For comparison, Cyfra21-1 and NSE were measured using ECLIA in our study. Although there is no statistical differences between the specificities of Cyfra21-1, NSE and the SELDI marker pattern, the sensitivity achieved by Cyfra21-1, NSE individually or in combination were significantly lower than that of the SELDI pattern. These results indicate that the SELDI pattern is distinctly superior to Cyfra21-1 and NSE individually or combined in distinguishing lung cancer patients from healthy individuals.</offsets></p><p><offsets xml_i="19522" xml_f="20059" txt_i="13673" txt_f="14210">Based on the results of the blinded test set, we found that the sensitivity of the SELDI marker pattern for NSCLCs was significantly higher than for SCLCs, indicating that the pattern may be more effective in discriminating NSCLC patients from healthy controls than SCLC patients.
